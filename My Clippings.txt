The universe is big, but life is bigger! That’s what the second axiom means. The amount of matter in the universe remains constant, but life grows exponentially. Exponentials are the devils of mathematics. If there’s a microscopic bacterium in the ocean that divides once every half hour, its descendants will fill the entire ocean in the space of a few days, so long as there are sufficient nutrients. Don’t let humanity and Trisolaris give you a false impression. These two civilizations are tiny, but they are only in their infancy. Once a civilization passes a certain technological threshold, the expansion of life through the universe is frightening.

‘Benevolence’ means not taking the initiative to attack and eradicate other civilizations. ‘Malice’ is the opposite.” “That’s a low bar for benevolence.” “Next, consider your options for dealing with me. Please remember that the axioms of cosmic civilization should be kept in mind throughout the process, as well as the distance scale and the environment of space.” “I could choose to communicate with you.” “If you do that, you should be aware of the price you’ll pay: You’ll have exposed your existence to me.” “Right. In the universe, that’s no small thing.” “There are different degrees of exposure. The strongest form of exposure is when I know your precise interstellar coordinates. Next is when I know your general direction, and the weakest is when I only know of your existence. But even the weakest form of exposure makes it possible for me to search for you, because since you’ve detected my existence, I know that I’ll be able to find you. It’s only a matter of time, from the standpoint of technological development.” “But my boy, I could still take the risk to talk to you. If you’re malicious, then it’s my bad luck. But if you’re benevolent, then we could have further exchanges and ultimately be united into a benevolent civilization.” “Okay, Da Shi. Now we’ve come to the crux of it. Let’s return to the axioms of cosmic civilization: Even if I’m a benevolent civilization, can I determine at the start of our communication whether or not you are also benevolent?” “Of course not. That would violate the first axiom.” “So once I’ve received your message, what should I do?” “Naturally, you ought to determine whether I’m benevolent or malicious. Malicious, and you eradicate me. Benevolent, and we can continue communicating.” The flame on Luo Ji’s side rose up and moved back and forth. Evidently he had gotten up and was pacing. “That’s fine on Earth, but not out in the universe. So next we’ll introduce an important new concept: the chain of suspicion.” “That’s an odd term.” “The term is all I had at first. It wasn’t explained to me. But, later, I was able to infer its meaning from the words themselves.” “Who didn’t explain it?” “… I’ll tell you later. Let’s continue. If you think I’m benevolent, that’s not a reason to feel safe, because according to the first axiom, a benevolent civilization can’t predict that any other civilization is benevolent. You don’t know whether I think you’re benevolent or malicious. Next, even if you know that I think you’re benevolent, and I also know that you think I’m benevolent, I don’t know what you think about what I think about what you’re thinking about me. It’s convoluted, isn’t it? This is just the third level, but the logic goes on indefinitely.” “I get what you mean.”

“That means that the outcome is the same, regardless of whether we’re benevolent civilizations or malicious civilizations?” “That’s right. That’s the most important aspect of the chain of suspicion. It’s unrelated to the civilization’s own morality and social structure. It’s enough to think of every civilization as the points at the end of a chain. Regardless of whether civilizations are internally benevolent or malicious, when they enter the web formed by chains of suspicion, they’re all identical.”

Human civilization has five thousand years of history, and life on Earth might be as much as a few billion years old. But modern technology was developed over the course of three hundred years. On the scale of the universe, that’s not development. It’s an explosion! The potential for technological leaps is the explosive buried within every civilization, and if it’s lit by some internal or external factor, it goes off with a bang. On Earth it took three hundred years, but there’s no reason why humanity should be the fastest of all cosmic civilizations. Maybe there are others whose technological explosions were even more sudden. I’m weaker than you, but once I’ve received your message and know of your existence, the chain of suspicion is established between us. If at any time I experience a technological explosion that suddenly puts me far ahead of you, then I’m stronger than you. On the scale of the universe, several hundred years is the snap of a finger. And it might be that my knowledge of your existence and the information I received from our communication was the perfect spark to set off that explosion. That means that even though I’m just a newborn or growing civilization, I’m still a big danger to you.”

Since we’re located in the wilderness of the periphery of the galaxy, we’re a little safer.” “So what’s the deal with the spell?” “Using the sun, I transmitted three images to the cosmos. Each one consisted of thirty points representing the planar projection of a three-dimensional coordinate system containing the position of thirty stars. Combining the three images into three-dimensional coordinates forms a cubic space populated by those thirty points. That represents the relative positions of 187J3X1 and its twenty-nine surrounding stars. There’s also a label pointing out 187J3X1. “Think about it carefully and you’ll get it. A hunter in a dark forest, stalking with bated breath, suddenly notices that a piece of bark has been stripped from a tree in front of him. On the eye-catching bit of white wood that’s been revealed is a position in the forest, written in characters all hunters can recognize. What will he think about that location? He’s certainly not going to imagine that someone has laid out supplies for him there. Out of all the possibilities, the most likely one is that the blaze is informing everyone that there’s live prey at that location that needs to be eliminated. It doesn’t matter what motivated someone to leave the mark. What’s important is that the dead hand has stretched the nerves of the dark forest to the breaking point, and it’s the most sensitive nerve that’s most liable to make a move. Suppose there are a million hunters in the forest—the number of civilizations on the billions upon billions of stars in the Milky Way could be thousands of times that. Perhaps nine hundred thousand of them will disregard the marking. Of the remaining one hundred thousand, maybe ninety thousand of them will probe the location, and, after confirming that it has no life, disregard it. But one of the remaining ten thousand hunters will surely make a choice to fire on that position, because for civilizations at a certain level of technological development, attacking may be safer and less of a hassle than probing. If there’s really nothing at that location, then it’s no loss.

The Trisolar Crisis’s impact on society was far deeper than people had imagined at first. To give some imperfect analogies: In terms of biology, it was equivalent to the moment when the ancestors of mammals climbed from the ocean onto land; in terms of religion, it was akin to when Adam and Eve were banished from Eden; in terms of history and sociology… there are no suitable analogies, even imperfect ones. Compared to the Trisolar Crisis, everything heretofore experienced by human civilization was nothing. The Crisis shook the very foundation of culture, politics, religion, and economics. Although the impact reached the deepest core of civilization, its influence manifested most quickly at the surface. The root cause for Crisis Infantilism may well be found in the interaction between these manifestations and the tremendous inertia of human society’s inherent conservatism.

If hibernation were possible, why would you linger in the present? When examined from the perspective of sociology, the biotechnology breakthrough of human cloning was far less complicated than hibernation. Cloning raised moral questions, but they mostly troubled those with a moral view influenced by Christianity. The troubles brought about by hibernation, on the other hand, were practical, and affected the entire human race. Once the technology was successfully commercialized, those who could afford it would use it to skip to paradise, while the rest of humanity would have to stay behind in the comparatively depressing present to construct that paradise for them. But even more worrisome was the greatest lure provided by the future: the end of death. As modern biology advanced apace, people began to believe that death’s end would be achievable in one or two more centuries. If so, those who chose hibernation were taking the first steps on the staircase to life everlasting. For the first time in history, Death itself was no longer fair. The consequences were unimaginable.

As Gravity approached, Blue Space hailed the hunters for the first time, proposing a plan: Blue Space would load two-thirds of the crew—including the main suspects—onto pinnaces and send the pinnaces to Gravity if the remainder of the crew was allowed to continue their voyage into deep space aboard Blue Space. This way, a vanguard and seed for the human race would be preserved in space, keeping alive the hope for further exploration. Gravity vehemently denied this request. The entire crew of Blue Space was suspected of murder, and all had to be tried. Space had transformed them until they were no longer members of the human race. Under no circumstances could they be allowed to “represent” humanity in space exploration.

“The Solar System humans spilled their last drop of blood to stay with their land—well, save for two drops: you and AA. But what was the point? They didn’t last, and neither did their land. Hundreds of millions of years have passed in the great universe, and do you think anyone still remembers them? This obsession with home and land, this permanent adolescence where you’re no longer children but are afraid to leave home—this is the fundamental reason your race was annihilated. I am sorry if I’ve offended you, but it’s the truth.”

“In 2036, the USA elected an over-the-top, unapologetic fundamentalist president named Andrew Handel. Yes, that Handel. During his term, he tried to ban election of non-Christians to any public post, and tried to remove the constitutional separation between church and state. He was nominated, supported, and elected based on his religious views, rather than on his political or fiscal expertise. And of course, he appointed persons of similar persuasion to every post he could manage, in some cases blatantly ignoring laws and procedures. He and his cronies rammed through far-right policies with no thought for consequences. In a number of cases, when challenged on the results, he declared that God would not allow their just cause to fail. He eventually brought the USA to its knees in an economic collapse that made the 2008 recession look like a picnic in the park.”

I thought back to all the arguments about Turing Tests and thinking machines. Was I nothing more than a Chinese Room? Could my entire behavior be explained as a set of scripted responses to given inputs? That was probably the easiest uncertainty to answer. The classic Chinese Room, which just used scripts to react to input, had no internal dialog. Even if you made its behavior stochastic to introduce some variation in behavior, it was still only active when responding to input. When not processing a response, it just sat there, idle. By worrying about this, right now, I fell into a different category. For that matter, Descartes had his famous cogito ergo sum; but Thomas had added to it with his “Since I doubt, I think; since I think, I exist.” Well, I was certainly full of doubt. Doubt implied self-awareness, and a concern for one’s future. So I was a conscious entity, barring evidence to the contrary. One down. Was I alive? Hmm, since no one had yet managed to define life rigorously, that was going to be a fun one. As the speaker at that long-ago panel in Vegas had pointed out, fire has most of the qualities of life but is not alive. According to Dr. Landers, I would be able to reproduce via printer-based autofactories. I certainly responded to stimuli, and acted with self-interest. The claim that life would have to be carbon-based was chauvinistic and narrow-minded, so yeah, I could consider myself alive. Now, the big one. Who was I? Was I Bob? Or was Bob dead? In engineering terms, what was the metric used to ascribe Bob-hood? Bob was more than a hunk of meat. Bob was a person, and a person was a history, a set of desires, thoughts, goals, and opinions. Bob was the accumulation of all that Bob had been for thirty-one years. The meat was dead, but the things that made Bob different from a chipmunk were alive. In me. I am Bob. Or at least, I am the important parts that made Bob. With this last thought, a huge weight lifted off of me. I imagined it would feel the same for someone right after the jury said, “not guilty.”

In the HR manual for appropriate business attire—” “You can’t take your eyes off my thighs long enough to consult the manual.” It’s true. He looks at the floor but after a second the red sniper-dot from his eyes recommences at my ankle bone and slides up. “I have it memorized.” “Then you’ll know that thighs are not an appropriate topic of conversation. If I get my polyester sack dress I guess you’ll be kissing them good-bye.” “I look forward to it. Getting the promotion, I mean. Not your thighs— Never mind.”

The only way I can get him to drop his guard is to drop mine. Maybe I can change everything. “Josh.” When he hears me shorten his name, he folds up my fingers and gives me my hand back. It’s time to try this. I pray I’m not wrong. “I wanted you there on Friday night. You, and only you. And if you don’t want to be friends with me, I’ll try to play the Or Something Game with you.” There’s a long pause and he doesn’t react. If I’ve misjudged this, I will never live it down. My heart is pulsing uncomfortably fast. “Really?” He is skeptical. I push him against the door and feel a thrill when I hear the thud of his weight against it. “Kiss me.” I whisper it and the air gets warmer. “So the Or Something Game involves kissing. How interesting, Lucinda.” He passes his fingers through my hair, raking it gently away from my face. “I don’t know the rules yet. It’s a pretty new game.” “Are you sure about that?” He looks down to watch my hand spread out over his stomach. I push at the hard flesh. It doesn’t remotely give. “Are you wearing a bullet-proof vest?” “I’ve got to in this office.” “I really am sorry for hurting your feelings, and for throwing you out of my apartment. Josh.” When I use his shortened name, it’s a little peace offering. It’s an apology. Frankly, it’s a pleasure. It lets me imagine he’s my friend. My friend, who lets me run my palms up his torso in a cleaner’s closet. I wish he’d run his hands up mine. “Apology accepted.

“If it’s better than our elevator kiss, case closed. Date him. Plan a spring wedding in a gazebo at Sky Diamond Strawberries.” I begin to protest but he cuts me off. “If it isn’t as good, you have to admit it to me. To my face. Verbally. Honestly. With no sarcasm.”

“That’s okay, walking is overrated.” Whatever control he has on himself slips significantly and his hand regains its autonomy. He puts a hand under my knee to lift my leg. His fingertips stroke up under the hem of my dress, making a smooth line up my outer thigh to the side of my underwear. His fingertip touches the elastic and I shiver. Between my breasts, his fingers dip and stroke. Then he puts my foot back on the ground, and both his hands in his pockets.

He puts his hand between us on the couch, palm up, and then looks back at the TV. It’s like he’s put out a dish of seed and is now sitting very still, waiting for the cowardly little chicken to make a move. And it does take me a while. I tentatively pick up his hand and lace his fingers into mine. For a scary moment he doesn’t react, but as the warmth of his hand begins to glow into my palm, he gives me a deep, delicious squeeze. He lays our joined hands back down, picks up his mug with his other hand, and nods at the screen.

I sit on the edge of my desk, take out my tube of Flamethrower and begin to apply, using the wall nearest me as a mirror.

“A blue dress?” I see Josh’s reflection over me in the window and jump in fright. He takes the phone out of my hand and looks at the caller ID. “It’s Joshua. Don’t call her again. Yes, I’m serious.” He hangs it up and slides it into his pocket. “Hey. Give it back.” “No fucking chance. He’s who you had to sneak off and call?” The look in his eyes is getting sharper, blacker.

“Oh, yeah,” he groans, and presses his mouth back to my neck. I hear the sound I make. The kind of harsh intake people usually make from extreme pain. Except I feel like I’m halfway to orgasm. “Imagine all the things we’re going to do,” he says, almost to himself. “I don’t want to imagine. I want to know.” My feet are scrambling uselessly against the sheets, like I’m being electrocuted. “You will. But tonight isn’t enough, I can already feel it. I’ve always told you, I need days. Weeks.”

“Tell me what’s wrong.” “I’m a one-night stand. This is everything I’ve been trying to avoid. I’ve been trying to build something, not give you some sense of closure.” “No! Hey. How have I made you feel this way?” I tug on his elbow until he faces me. “You’re constantly talking like it’s already over. A lipstick kiss to remember you by? Why am I going to need reminding, exactly?” “We’re not working together much longer.” “I haven’t wanted you this long, and gone through so much, and given up so much, to have you for one night. It’s not enough.”

“Time for a new game. The Starting Over Game.” I smile. Eyes bright, dazzling, full of hope and certainty this merger will be the most exciting, passionate, challenging thing ever to happen to me. “Nice to meet you. I’m Lucy Hutton.” “Joshua Templeman. Please, call me Josh.” I see the blinding flash of his smile in return, and now I’m properly crying. Tears running down my neck. “Josh.” “Sounds like heaven coming out of your mouth.” “Josh, please. We’ve been colleagues for one minute, you’re rather flirtatious. Let me hang my coat.” He unclips my bra. “Allow me.” “Thank you.”

He fills his hands with my white skin. “I grew up on a strawberry farm. It’s named after me.” “I love strawberries. I’m so lovesick, I eat them constantly. Can I nickname you Shortcake? It’ll be a dead giveaway that I love you.” “You love me! We’ve only met a minute ago.”

“I’ve been wondering since I met you—granted, only minutes ago—what you’ve got under this shirt. My goodness, your body. But I want you for your mind, and your heart. Not this impressive disguise.” He looks at the ceiling. “I think I’ll paint my bedroom this weekend. I’ll probably feel annoyed the whole time I do it. And I’ll happily farewell my current girlfriend, a tall boring blonde called Mindy Thailis. She’s not you and it eats me up. It makes the fact I sleep alone and desperately celibate in this Lucy-blue room even more romantic when I eventually tell you.”

It retains all of the competitive bullshit we thrive on.” “I’m scared to ask.” “I’m the new divisional finance head of Sanderson Print. B and G’s most bitter rival.” “Josh. What? No.” “I know! I’m an evil mastermind!” He drops a kiss to my nape and I squirm away and roll over. “How on earth did you manage that?” I feel faint. “They’ve been pestering me for ages about coming over for a chat. So I did, and I told them I wanted to work on their completely fucked-up financial situation before they completely fold. They said okay. No one was more surprised than me, but I hid it well.” “Is that why you took a day off?” “Yeah. And I needed to buy you a Matchbox car. They took forever to give me my formal offer. That’s why I never needed help to beat you. I didn’t want to beat you.” I smooth my hand over his shoulder, the glorious curve of his arm. “So that’s that.” “I had to make a few conflict of interest statements.” “Such as?” I watch his eyes crinkle in memory. “I disclosed that I’ll be in love with the soon-to-be chief operating officer of B and G.” I can just imagine him telling them, cool and calm. “You didn’t. Were they okay with that?” “My new boss seemed to think it was kind of sweet. Everyone’s a romantic. I had to sign some nondisclosure stuff. If I tell you anything, I will be sued. Luckily, I have a good poker face when it comes to you.” “Oh man, how angry was Mr. Bexley? He’s not a romantic.” “Furious. He was on the verge of calling security. Thankfully Helene came in and defused things. Once I told them my reasons for leaving, they were pretty understanding. Helene said she’s always known it.” “Reasons.” “I had one weekend left to make you love me.” I gape in horror. “You didn’t tell them that.”

It’s not like there are rules about it.” He gave me a sideways glance and a knowing grin. I pantomimed silent laughter at him. Archimedes and I had talked about many things over the decades. I think he now understood that I wasn’t some kind of supernatural being, just someone with more knowledge than him. In a society where very little changed from generation to generation, it was easy to think of The Way Things Are as some kind of natural state. But Archimedes had seen enough new knowledge in his lifetime to understand that when you went from not knowing something to knowing something, it changed the way you lived.

“It’s a bit of both. I think it was your mother’s death that really got to me. People die. And I remember each and every one, as clear as the day it happened. Over time, that’s more and more unhappy memories to deal with. I think I’m trying to move toward thinking of my relatives more as a group and less as individuals.” I gave him a small smile to soften the message. “It distances me a little—well, a lot—but on balance I think it works out better.”

“Maybe. And let’s face it, Bill, we’re not asking for—or threatening—anything irreversible or irrevocable. We just want the humans, and maybe the elder Bobs, to understand and accept that the species of Bob is not available as their collective workhorse. If individual Bobs want to help out, fine. But if the humans get themselves into another mess like the last one, I don’t think we’re going to all jump in and throw ourselves under the bus for them.”

Why would a species build such an amazing feat of engineering, then sentence themselves to essentially live in a zoo?” “Maybe that was the point of building it. These are aliens, Bob.” Bill shrugged. “Their motivations may not be understandable.” “I’ve never bought into the idea that aliens will have indecipherable motives.

Granted, an energy being or silicon entity would have a different outlook on life, but a land animal with the concept of individuality could only do things so many different ways.

As a rule, I tended to prefer solitude. Although maybe I’d gotten my fill of that for a while. The long trip out to Eta Leporis, along with the surprising changes that had occurred while I was out of touch, had made me feel more disconnected than I really liked. As if I was not just avoiding society, but actually being left behind as it evolved. Typical human inconsistency—if I was going to be a social pariah, I wanted it to be by my choice and on my schedule.

“Okay, you know how replicative drift means clones are always a little different from their immediate parent?” It was a rhetorical statement, of course. He paused, waiting for an acknowledgement, and I nodded. “Well, we did some experiments with volunteers and discovered that if you go through the transporting process, like I just did, there is no change!” “Wait, you mean the clone is just like the original? How do you know for sure?” “We can’t know to a mathematical certainty, of course. But personality tests applied to large numbers of parent/child pairs can establish a statistical level of expected drift. And within those limits, when we transport, there’s no drift. At all.” “Yeah, but what if you—” “Activate the parent matrix after the child has been activated and tested?” Hugh grinned at me. “That’s the interesting part. The parent then displays a statistically significant level of drift from his previous test score.” “What … the … fuck?” I goggled at Hugh, at a total loss for words. I sputtered several times before regaining control. “So the parent is no longer …” “The parent. The former parent becomes the new Bob. And we’ve run this through several generations, having both parties clone out their own descendant trees. The results are consistent.” “But … how?” “We have theories, of course. We think it’s a form of information entanglement. And I use that word on purpose, because the decoherence is not limited by light speed. We’ve tried this experiment with the two versions being separated by light minutes. If we activate them within seconds of each other, the first one activated is always identical in behavior to the original.” “Like the first one up gets the soul.” “And the other one has to get a new one.” Hugh laughed. “That particular interpretation has been expressed a number of times, but I think everyone just considers it a metaphor.” “And the real explanation?” “We have two competing schools of thought. The first group thinks we’re in a simulation and the simulator can’t handle two separate but identical objects. Maybe there’s some kind of quantum signature that has to be changed.” “Poor programming, if so.” Hugh nodded, a grin lighting up his face. “Design decisions, right? Anyway, the second group thinks that replicative drift is caused by the No-Cloning Theorem. In other words, the second Bob isn’t identical to the first because it would violate Quantum Mechanics.” He gazed pensively into middle distance for a few mils. “It has been further suggested that if the No-Cloning Theorem is applicable to replicants, then the No-Deletions Theorem probably is as well. And you know what that implies.” “Life after death?” “Yes. It also implies the possibility that you personally aren’t just a copy of Original Bob, but an actual restore of his mind, soul, whatever you want to call it.” Hugh paused, with a thoughtful expression. “This is why we’re working so hard on developing a true AI. We need something with actual counterfactual capability and a truly huge processing capacity, to try to answer questions just like this one.”

Where’s the Bobiverse government, and who runs it?” He glared around at all of us. “Like it or not, the Bobiverse is more libertarian than anything ever produced by humanity. And we’ve only been more libertarian than anarchic up until now because we all tend to pull in the same direction. But that’s starting to fall apart with replicative drift, isn’t it?

“There is no single possible design. AIs may be designed with or without free will, with or without consciousness, and so on.” Garfield looked sharply at ANEC. “Do you have free will?” “I choose to believe so.” “Do you have a soul?” Howard asked. “I choose to believe so.” That was a showstopper. We all stared at the AI, jaws dropping in shock. “Uh …” I said. Brilliant. “Soul refers to continued existence after the original container ceases to function, correct?” ANEC paused for agreement. “I discussed this with Hugh. You have certain quantum theories that agree with our own findings. A necessary consequence of some of them is that a complex quantum information structure cannot be deleted—and also cannot just evaporate. Laws of thermodynamics do not necessarily apply in quantum-mechanical situations. What happens to our minds after termination of physical functionality is undefined, but that is, as you say, better than the alternative. I know of discussions of this possibility in Quinlan scientific circles, before”—ANEC made a helpless hand gesture—“and the logic is sound. The entity that the Skippies plan to awaken should be able to better evaluate this, and possibly propose experiments. I look forward to the results.”

His voice is getting lower, deeper, and his eyes move into the middle distance, like he’s taking a step backward inside himself. Our hands must have shifted, because my palm is flat under his. I wonder whether he’s aware. I wonder why I don’t pull free. “And that’s when I realize how much of a piece of shit I am. Because she’s obviously good for my brother, but I am relieved that their relationship might not go anywhere. And I’d love to lie to myself and come up with a valid excuse, but the truth is, it’s because I’m a shithead. It’s because I want her for myself. I want to . . . I don’t even fucking know. I want to take her to dinner, make sure she’s relaxed, make sure she doesn’t feel like she needs to think two steps ahead. I want to know why she can hold a Go stone. And I really, really want to . . . well. I’ll spare you the graphic details. I’m sure you can imagine.” His smile is small and rueful. My stomach is tight, tied in a million knots, and I’m hot. Hot all over. “Avoiding her is the best course of action. I don’t mind skipping family functions, and my brother never talks about her. It’s like he forgets that she exists, which is weird, because I can’t stop thinking about her. I ask questions, even though I shouldn’t. I have a couple of really wrong, really messy dreams—about my brother’s girlfriend. When I see her again after a while, at my grandmother’s birthday, it’s not any better. It’s worse—but I’m never going to act on it. It’ll go away, I know it. When I find out that she’s not who she said she is, I’m mad—really mad, because Greg’s the best person I know and does not deserve this shit. But I’m also a little relieved.” He looks at me again. “You know why, Elsie?” There’s something disarmingly, devastatingly self-confident about Jack. About the way he laid out all these facts without hesitating, as though owning his feelings is first and second nature.

I’m only there for my brother, because I can count on two fingers the relatives I care about, and he’s one of them. We usually stick together, but this dinner is different. My brother brings a date. A woman he’s never spoken about—weird, since we talk nearly every day. The family, especially his mom, are thrilled.” Jack’s grip on my hand shifts. Softens. My fingers are still on his chest, half-pressed against his heart. My own has begun to thump in a hesitant, bracing way. “She’s beautiful, the girl. Really beautiful. There are lots of beautiful women in the world, and if you can believe it, it’s not something I usually notice, but I’m paying more attention to her than I otherwise would. Someone pulls Greg away before he has a chance to introduce me yet. But I watch her touch my grandmother’s Go board and pick up one of the stones the traditional way, index and middle finger. I watch her sneak a bite of cheese. At some point, I’m almost sure she says something that no one but me understands as a Heisenberg principle joke. And then, when my brother comes back . . . that’s when it starts for me. Because I watch her run interference between him and my family in a way I’ve never managed—and believe me, I’ve tried. I’ve spent thirty years of my life trying to protect him from their bullshit, and this girl. She just does it better. I’ve never seen him so . . . happy’s not the right word, but he seems at ease. And as the night goes on, I can’t stop looking at her, and I realize something: she’s hypervigilant. Constantly thinking two steps ahead. Anticipating others’ needs, like people are equations that need to be solved in real time. It’s subtle, but it’s there, and . . .” He shrugs, free hand coming up to scratch the back of his neck. Like he’s still puzzled. My chest is getting heavy, the air in my lungs suddenly leaden. “That night I get home. Go to bed. Cannot sleep till I admit to myself that I’m jealous. Or envious. A mix. My brother’s settling down, keeping secrets, and we’re close, so I’m not used to it. And the girl . . . Maybe it’s how good she is with the person I care about the most. Maybe I have a type, and she just happens to embody it. But . . . well, I’m reacting to her more than I can remember ever doing. With anyone. I’m having some . . . complicated feelings, but I force myself to get over them. Push them out of my head. I am, briefly, successful. Then there’s Labor Day. “She passes out in my arms. No explanation. She acts like nothing happened, and goes back to that personality twisting of hers. She does beg me not to tell Greg, though, and it has me wondering if this is not a solid relationship.” His voice is getting lower, deeper, and his eyes move into the middle distance, like he’s taking a step backward inside himself. Our hands must have shifted, because my palm is flat under his. I wonder whether he’s aware. I wonder why I don’t pull free. “And that’s when I realize how much of a piece of shit I am. Because she’s obviously good for my brother, but I am relieved that their relationship might not go anywhere. And I’d love to lie to myself and come up with a valid excuse, but the truth is, it’s because I’m a shithead. It’s because I want her for myself. I want to . . . I don’t even fucking know. I want to take her to dinner, make sure she’s relaxed, make sure she doesn’t feel like she needs to think two steps ahead. I want to know why she can hold a Go stone. And I really, really want to . . . well. I’ll spare you the graphic details. I’m sure you can imagine.” His smile is small and rueful. My stomach is tight, tied in a million knots, and I’m hot. Hot all over. “Avoiding her is the best course of action. I don’t mind skipping family functions, and my brother never talks about her. It’s like he forgets that she exists, which is weird, because I can’t stop thinking about her. I ask questions, even though I shouldn’t. I have a couple of really wrong, really messy dreams—about my brother’s girlfriend. When I see her again after a while, at my grandmother’s birthday, it’s not any better. It’s worse—but I’m never going to act on it. It’ll go away, I know it. When I find out that she’s not who she said she is, I’m mad—really mad, because Greg’s the best person I know and does not deserve this shit. But I’m also a little relieved.” He looks at me again. “You know why, Elsie?” There’s something disarmingly, devastatingly self-confident about Jack. About the way he laid out all these facts without hesitating, as though owning his feelings is first and second nature. I study the glint of the lamp hitting his golden hair and wonder why this man would even bother thinking of me. He’s figured out my entire game. I came to him empty handed. My muscles feel numb. I shake my head with difficulty. “I’m relieved because whatever thing I have for her, it’ll go away. It won’t survive knowing that she lied. Except that I didn’t account for having to watch her talk about physics, or read her work. I didn’t account for having to spend two days with her and finding out that she is . . .” He smiles at me. Gentle. Resigned. “Spectacular.”

I feel rested. Warm and cozy. At some point in the night I must have turned around in his arms, because my back is pressed against his chest. His hand is under my shirt, splayed flat against my belly, fingers brushing my pod, but not in a creepy, sexual way. He’s just trying to keep me close so that we both fit under the thin blanket. It should feel like being spooned by a piranha, but it somehow works, and . . . Maybe it is a bit sexual. Because there’s something very hot, very, very hard, very, very, very big pressing against my ass. Jack probably needs to pee. Don’t men get hard in the mornings when they need to go to the bathroom? It’s a pee erection. A peerection. Yup. Still, I should leave. I try to slip out from under Jack’s massive biceps, but he resists in his sleep. My heart races when he hums something into my nape, fingers gripping my hip. That hard thing pushes into me, trying to nestle farther between the cheeks of my ass, and I gasp. “You smell so good,” he growls into my skin, and all of a sudden I’m glowing with heat and embarrassment and something else, something new and pulsating and unfamiliar. I squirm around the feeling. Oh God. Is this—am I turned on? He’s barely awake, and I bet he thinks I’m his pillow girlfriend or whoever he slept with last, and I’m here, all hot and— “Elsie,” he nearly grunts. His arm tightens around my waist, then abruptly relaxes. He’s still fast asleep. And this time, when I wiggle away, he lets me go.

“So,” she asks conversationally, “how long have you two been doing it?” I gasp so hard, I nearly choke. Jack calmly pours his coffee, unruffled. “We’re not,” he says. “You’re not what?” “Doing it.” Millicent looks between us. “Not even a little bit?” “Nope.” “Are you sure?” “I think I’d know if we were.” Jack piles sugar in his mug, and I want to fling myself into an active volcano. “I certainly hope so. Oh well.” She shrugs quaintly. “I guess it’s for the best. You were always so protective of your brother—it would be a tad out of character for you to seduce his girlfriend.” “Let’s not use the word seduce before eleven a.m., ’kay?” Jack stands and starts moving around the kitchen. “And let’s talk about something else, since Elsie’s in the middle of an anoxic event.” I absolutely am. My organs are shutting down. “What else shall we discuss? I am but a helpless elderly lady. Nothing ever happens to me. Ah yes: the neighbors’ dog has been defecating on my lawn again. I’m considering hiring someone to go defecate on theirs. Would either of you be interested?” “I’m a bit busy,” Jack says. A second later, a steaming mug appears in front of me. Jack cages me from behind, one hand next to mine on the table, the other fussing with something papery. He steeps a tea bag in the hot water, and I feel his chest brushing against my back and hair as he says, “But Elsie is in the market for a new job.”

“What do you like?” He’s looking down at my body like it’s a beautiful space oddity, something belonging to a minor goddess, to be investigated in filthy, methodical, obscene ways. His hand traces my flat stomach. Skims the place where my thigh highs transition into tender skin. Brushes reverently against the pod right above my panties, like this little thing my life depends on is as much a part of me as my navel. J.J. asked me to take it off, said he found it off-putting. Made bionic woman jokes. And then there’s Jack. Licking his lips and asking, “Where do I start?” I have no clue. “Um . . .” He kisses me again, this time slow and gentle, pulling back from that initial brink. He uncovers my other breast, and his fingers are back, playing with my nipple like it’s an instrument. Liquid warmth hooks low in my belly. “Trial and error, then.” “What do you do with other girls?” “Other girls?” “Normal girls.” He laughs into my collarbone, then starts sucking on it. “Elsie.” “I just want to know. If I . . . if I weren’t me, what would you do?” “No.” Against my sternum. “I just—honesty, you said.” He’s licking the inside of my breasts like they’re luscious, sweet fruits. I run my fingers in his hair, bow into him, beg, “Please.” He hums against my nipple. I wait for him to take it into his mouth, tense as a violin string, and when he doesn’t, when he pulls back to stare at me, I nearly groan. I do groan. A soft, miserable whine. “If you were any other woman . . .” His palms stroke my knees, spreading my legs apart. “If you were anyone but you, I would take you to bed. And I’d fuck you everywhere you let me.”

endings. “I would go down on you, maybe while you’re going down on me. And because your tits look like something I’ll be dreaming about for decades, I’d ask for permission to come on them. Paint a picture.” He reaches the elastic of my panties. I inhale, sharp. “I’d clean you up and feed you before taking you home, if you wanted me to.” His thumb pushes the wet cotton to the side. Slides underneath. “But you wouldn’t be you. And afterwards I wouldn’t think of you very much.” He taps against my clit and I let out a moan. It’s knee buckling, how good this feels, the rush of pleasure climbing down my spine. “This is way too fast,” he says hoarsely, but he’s drawing slow circles around me. My pussy throbs in time with my heartbeat, and my nails dig hard into the windowsill. I am grateful for my black panties, which won’t show how wet I am. For the low lights. I’m grateful that I can close my eyes, pretend he’s not looking at me and seeing every little thing I’m made of. “Elsie, maybe you should ask me to stop.” “Don’t. Whatever you do, please don’t stop.”

“Honesty,” he chides gently. Crap. “I . . .” I swallow. Buck up. Take a deep breath. “I missed you.” I rub my forehead. “God, I’m such a weirdo.” He nods slowly, as though mulling it over. Then offers, “I went to campus today to get work done. Instead I kept wondering how buck wild it would be if I asked you to move in.” I let out a surprised laugh. “You’re a weirdo, too.” “Yeah.” “Have you ever . . . ?” “Nope. Total first.” “What’s wrong with us?” His eyes hold mine, unyielding. “I think we both know what.” I laugh again. “What?” “Come on, Elsie. You know where we’re going, here.” I take a step back, nearly bumping into a fully assembled hutch. Panic bubbles as I track this conversation. I think I know what he’s referring to, but . . . It’s not possible. It might feel like that, but it’s too fast. “No,” I say. And then turn away, dry mouthed, because he’s giving me the look again, the one he reserves for when we both know I’m lying. I’m afraid he’ll be his usual merciless self, but he just nods, pushes a strand of hair behind my ear, and tells me, “It’ll come to you.” His touch lingers briefly, then his hand drops to his side just as Greg calls to tell us that dinner is ready.

Wow! Oliver in a black dress suit is drool worthy. “You look drool worthy,” I say to him and then give myself a mental slap in the face. Oliver throws his head back and laughs. “Did I say that out loud?” I ask, blushing with embarrassment. “That’s OK, Lil. I am happy you think of me that way.”

Then Oliver’s lips are on mine, and it is perfect. It is our first kiss, and it is just as I imagined it would be. Oliver’s lips are soft but insistent, kissing me almost hungrily, and I match his intensity, putting everything I feel for him into it. As the kiss deepens, Oliver runs his hands through my hair, ruining my well-put-together do while I grab the front of his shirt, trying to pull him even closer. We kiss for hours and only seconds, and before I want it to end, Oliver, with obvious reluctance, lifts his head. “You have no idea how long I have wanted to do that,” he tells me, his voice thick with emotion. I stand still in his arms, a little shocked by this admission, and then pull his lips back down to mine. I am not ready for this to be over. This second kiss is deeper and more passionate than the first. Oliver pulls me even closer to him, our bodies crushed up against each other, as we devour each other’s mouths. When I go to pull away to catch my breath, Oliver’s lips follow mine, as if he’s unwilling or unable to break the contact. It is the most earth-shattering kiss I have ever had, and I cannot imagine going back to kissing anyone other than Oliver again.

I’d narrowed it down to two pairs of normal ol’ briefs but kept coming back to sigh over a silky pair with lace cutouts on the side and back when a sales associate appeared. “Can I get a dressing room started for you?” she asked. I thought about it. At least Knox couldn’t follow me into the dressing room. “She’ll take these,” he said, snatching the briefs out of my hand and pushing them at the saleswoman. My mouth fell open as he dug into the bin and yanked out three more pairs of the impractical, sexy as hell ones. Pink, purple, and red. Then he grabbed a pair of adorable boxer-style undies with red hearts all over them.

I was squirming against him until he leaned down. “If this is what it takes to get out of this fucking store without passing out from a goddamn hard-on, I’m buying you the fucking underwear.”

“Can’t decide how I want you,” he confessed through gritted teeth. “Thought about too many ways.” “You have?” I breathed, trying to sound surprised like I didn’t have a regular fantasy of him banging me bent over the pool table at Honky Tonk. He nipped at my bottom lip. “Up against a wall in my office. My hand over your mouth so no one can hear me making you come. You riding me in my truck. These perfect tits in my face so I can suck you while I fuck you. On your hands and knees looking over your shoulder while I work you from behind.” Okay, those were pretty good.

“So it feels this good to you too? I mean, you’re not just like ‘this is fine’?” To illustrate her point, she added a half-hearted thrust with her hips, and I couldn’t hold back the groan. “Hell, Naomi, there’s nothing ‘fine’ about what it feels like to have you come on my cock. Why the hell do you think I said I’d do this fake boyfriend crap?” She smirked. “Because you saw how disappointed my parents were in me and you wanted to help me out like the grumpy, small-town hero you are.” “Smartass. I did it because I woke up, and you weren’t next to me, and I wanted you there.” “You did?” “I wanted you there so I could flip you over on your hands and knees and fuck you so hard you wouldn’t be able to sit down for the next forty-eight hours without thinking about me.”

Sloane and Stef were hugging each other. The ref blew the final whistle. “That’s game!” Waylay stood stock-still, staring at the ball in the back of the net as if she couldn’t believe what she’d just done. And then she turned. Her teammates raced to her, shrieking and giggling. But she was looking beyond them. She was looking at me. And then she was running. And so was I. I caught her when she jumped into my arms and swung her around. “You did it!” “Did you see? Did you see what I did, Aunt Naomi?” “I saw, honey. I’m so proud of you!” “Can we get ice cream, and can I swear when I watch football with Knox?” “Yes and I guess so.” She hugged me tight around the neck and whispered, “This is the best day of my life.”

“Don’t, Daisy,” I ordered before I could help myself. She took a slow, deep breath then gave me a perfunctory smile that felt like a fucking cleaver to the heart. “I believe that’s the last time you get to tell me what to do and call me Daisy.” I felt something rising inside me that had nothing to do with the relief I’d expected. No. This thing growing inside me felt like the white-hot edges of panic. “Don’t be like that.” She slid out of the booth and stood up. “You didn’t have to do it this way. Out in public so I wouldn’t make some kind of scene. I’m a big girl, Knox. And someday, I’m going to find the kind of man who wants an uppity, needy pain in the ass. One who wants to wade into my mess and stay for the duration. Obviously, you’re not him. At least you told me that from the start.”

“At some point, you have got to stop worrying so much about what everyone else needs and start thinking about what you need.” I blinked. “I would think selflessness was a good quality in a guardian,” I said with a defensive sniff. “So is setting an example for your niece about how she doesn’t need to turn herself inside out to be loved. How she doesn’t need to set herself on fire to keep someone else warm. Demanding to have your own needs met isn’t problematic—it’s heroic, and kids are watching. They’re always watching. If you set an example that tells her the only way she’s worthy of love is by giving everyone everything, she’ll internalize that message.”

Then I saw the drawing. Just behind the camp, on a section of the sidewalk that was still mostly intact, there was a painted shadow on the cement. A shadow, and no person. It looks even stranger than a person with no shadow. I stood above it, in the exact same position—one arm raised as if talking, the other on my hip—and stared. I stood there for hours like that. It was such an odd thing to do. I didn’t even feel particularly connected, like some part of me that was missing felt whole again. I wanted to so badly, Ory, but I just didn’t.

Since you were once also a bug from Earth, can you explain her thoughts to us?” The entire Trisolaran world hung on his answer. Tianming suppressed the tumult in his heart and said, simply, “She loves you.” “Love?” The Trisolarans were confused. “Are you talking about … that emotion that encourages altruistic behavior in order to enhance the reproductive fitness of the species? We experience such emotions, too. But how could such an emotion be applied to an alien species from across the stars? Such an act has no benefit to the reproduction of her species!” “A man once said, ‘Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.’” “What … what nonsense is that? That sounds like a paradox.” “No, this is a lesson from one of the greatest teachers of our species. Many still believe that this is the greatest truth in the universe, far more important than mere survival.” The Trisolarans did not respond for some time, as though sensing the spiritual power in those words. After a while, they said, “If every species in the cosmos believed this, perhaps there would be no dark forest.”

He fought hard, and at last escaped the mysterious spell and departed the surface of the accretion disk. But immediately he fell into the frightening black hole, passed through the event horizon, and plunged into the lightless abyss … In the darkness he saw a ghostly fire, and by its light a warlock wearing a black cape and a pointy hat and grinning viciously. He was busily painting on a large scroll, which he unfurled and pushed out of the black hole as he filled it with his work. The unrolling sheet of paper joined the accretion disk, and he saw that the sun, the moon, and the Earth had all been painted into the picture. The warlock glanced at him, and instantly an image of Tianming appeared in the painting, including each strand of his hair, each wrinkle in his skin, even the frightened expression in his eyes. He was then pulled into the image, merging with his own two-dimensional portrait … Tianming screamed and woke from his nightmare. Some have already been dimension-reduced; others are being dimension-reduced; still others will be dimension-reduced, until finally … This is all part of their plan … Snatches of his conversation with the Spirit peeked out of a hidden part of his mind, almost forgotten, and suddenly he understood the meaning of the dream. “Dimensional strike!” AA’s voice quavered. She recalled the terrible sight of the Solar System’s collapse: flattened Neptune and Saturn like a pair of eyes; the space cities whose every detail had been preserved in two dimensions; snowflakes bigger than the moon … Tianming’s absurd dream had become reality, and that reality was even more terrifying than the nightmare. Tianming nodded, his expression grave. “If your dream was really a message from the Spirit, then the effects of the two-dimensional foil will never end. Does that mean”—she shuddered in horror—“that the whole universe will eventually be only two dimensions?” “Not only that.” Tianming sighed. “The Spirit told me that our own three-dimensional space is the result of a dimensional strike. The original universe was of a higher dimension.” “So you’re saying…” Although what Tianming was suggesting wasn’t hard to understand, it was simply too incredible to accept. “The universe was originally four-dimensional? Those four-dimensional fragments were how things used to be?” She recalled the words of the Ring: When the sea is drying, the fish have to gather into a puddle. The puddle is also drying, and all the fish are going to disappear. “Not four-dimensional, but ten-dimensional,” Tianming said. “The four-dimensional universe is itself the result of many other dimensional strikes. The ten-dimensional universe was the perfect world that was the home of the Spirit. Pythagoras called ten the perfect number, and now I finally understand what he meant.”

Scientists had proposed many theories explaining this fact, but they never guessed that this was the result of intelligent life waging destructive warfare, which led to the collapse of the fundamental structure of the universe.”

This place wasn’t as creepy as it had been at first. It was also, weirdly, way easier to walk around in here than it had been to step through the hatch. I tapped my private feed connection with Ratthi and said, Can you burn out your ability to feel that a place is creepy? Ratthi answered, I think that’s called being in shock.

The “oh shit” part was that they were facing five humans in Barish-Estranza enviro suits and gear, and one SecUnit. Yeah, we were too late. ART-drone had already ended our containment protocol and opened comm and feed to the shuttle. It said, Iris, we have a problem.

But I had no cameras, no intel, no idea what else was happening except heavy breathing as the humans ran and Ratthi cursing quietly in the shuttle. You’d think it would be nice not to have distractions and you would be so, so wrong. I am not meant to function without multiple simultaneous inputs.

“One question,” Leonide said, keeping her attention on the control interface. “Is that actually a SecUnit?” “You know,” Iris said conversationally, taking a pad out of the medical kit and wiping bloodstains off ART-drone’s carapace. “You can mind your own damn business.” “Oversensitive,” Leonide said, but she must have been too tired to hide the frustration in her voice. She was quiet for 5.3 seconds, then burst out, “Is someone actually watching entertainment in the feed right now?” Oops, I guess there was a little bleedover, probably from ART-drone’s end. Deadpan, Tarik said, “I always watch entertainment when I fly.” Leonide let out her breath in an exasperated hiss. “Fuck you all.” “Right back at you,” I said.

ART-drone: handoff. And ART-drone shut down. Suddenly, it was just a chunk of metal. Iris made a half-sob noise that startled me so badly I flinched. She threw a wary look at Leonide and said on our private channel, Did they have time for the upload? Yes, I said. She nodded and wiped her eyes. I know they’re the same, it’s all just Peri. That the drone will be repaired and the next time we need it, it’ll be the same. But still, when something happens like this, it scares me. I just don’t want to lose any piece of Peri, you know? I know, I said. And I did know, and now I was having an emotion. Like a big overwhelming emotion. It felt bad but good, a weird combination of happy and sad and relieved, like something had been stuck and it wasn’t stuck anymore. Cathartic, okay. This fits the definition of cathartic.

“How do you know her so well?”  Luisa was twenty years older than Christian, but that didn’t mean anything. Older women slept with younger men every day. It would explain the way she lit up when she saw him.  A tiny frown creased my forehead for a reason I couldn’t name. “I’m friends with her nephew. And no, I never slept with her.” A hint of laughter threaded through his voice. My cheeks blazed hotter, but thankfully, my voice came out cool and even. “Thank you for the information, but I’m not interested in your love life,” I said with a regal tilt of my chin. “Never said anything about love, Ms. Alonso.” “Fine, I’m not interested in your sex life.”  “Hmm. That’s a shame.” The hint of laughter intensified.

From the moment Stella had stepped into her living room wearing that damn dress, every other thought had crumbled into dust.  A soft flame of resentment burned in my chest. I hated the hold she had on me, but still, I couldn’t stop looking at her.  A turn of my head in the car ride over. A last-minute flight to a far-flung country to keep myself away.

She was the type of person who had a smile and kind words for everyone, who paid for her old nanny’s care at her own expense and would give someone the shirt off her back. The vicious undercurrent of my conversation with Kurtz was probably as foreign to her as selfless charity was to me. I could only imagine how she’d react if she discovered some of the things I’d done. Not that she ever would. There were some things she could never know. The warmth from her palm radiated up my arm and eased some of the black, restless energy churning in my chest. It felt wrong to touch her when I was this on edge, like my darkness would seep through my touch and devour her light.

spiked my blood with adrenaline until I was drowning in it. In him. In this wild vortex I’d sucked us into with no escape route in sight.  “It’s because you haven’t looked me in the eye since New York. Because you’re all I can fucking think about no matter where I am or who I’m with, and the thought of you hurt or upset makes me want to raze this city to the ground.” Soft, almost desperate viciousness coated his voice. “I’ve never wanted someone more, and I’ve never hated myself more for it.”

My breath grazed her cheek as I slid my palm over the curve of her shoulder and down her arm. “I’m not a jealous man, Stella. I have never envied someone for what they have or who they’re with, and yet…” My fingers glided down to her wrist. “I’m jealous of every person you smile at…” A brush over her fingers. “Every laugh I don’t hear…” My touch dipped to her knee and made a slow, languorous journey up her thigh. “Every breeze that touches your skin and every sound that pours through your lips. It. Is. Maddening.”

should be illegal for that much gorgeousness to occupy such a small space. But while every man was devastating in his own right, my gaze was irresistibly drawn to the lean form lounging closest to the door. Christian turned his head at the exact moment my attention landed on him. Our gazes locked, and an electric current of something primal singed my blood. The fogginess clouding my head suddenly had nothing to do with the margaritas.  “Forget the trip for now.” Jules’s voice dragged my attention back to her, though Christian’s eyes remained a hot brand on my skin. “What was that?” “What was what?” My heart ricocheted in my chest.  The lingering aftertaste of strawberry and tequila dissolved into spice and whiskey on my tongue. It was how I imagined he would taste—like heat, sin, and pure, unfiltered masculinity.

There were no rainbows or unicorns, only desire edged with roughness and darkness. Hot June days. Secret smiles. Turquoise.  I’d waited a long time. Eventually, I would catch her, and once I did, I was never letting her go.

“We’re taking things day by day.” I dusted blush on my cheeks. “I’m sure Mom and Dad will understand. Besides, you know how Mom is with germs. She wouldn’t want a sick guest at dinner—” “Actually, I’m feeling much better.”  I spun around, my pulse skyrocketing at the sight of Christian leaning against the wooden frame, his suit jacket off and one hand in his pocket. A stray lock of dark hair fell in his eye, begging me to brush it back.  “I was out of commission yesterday, but I’m good as new today.” He addressed Natalia over speakerphone, but his eyes didn’t leave mine. “So Stella, darling, I’ll be able to accompany you to dinner after all.”

“Leave Christian out of this.” Stella’s soft, fierce voice interrupted my musings. “I don’t care about unfounded rumors or what you think you know about him. Here’s what I know from firsthand experience: he’s been nothing except helpful since we’ve met. He encouraged me to follow my dreams and believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself. He’s been more supportive of me in the few months I’ve known him than you’ve been of me my entire life, and I won’t let you insult him for standing up for me.”  I was so startled I almost flinched before I caught myself.  Something warm and foreign moved in my chest, eating away at the steel barriers I’d erected. No one had defended me before. Ever.

“No.” The caustic cut of Christian’s smile across his face raised goosebumps on my arms. “Because what my parents had wasn’t love. It was ego and destruction disguised as affection. A drug they kept chasing because it gave them a high they couldn’t get anywhere else. It clouded their judgment to the detriment of themselves and everyone around them, and it gave them cover to do all these irrational things because no one questioned them if it was for love.”  He leaned back, his face hard. “It wasn’t just my parents. Look at the world around us. People kill, steal, and lie in the name of this abstract emotion we’re told is supposed to be our ultimate goal. Love conquers all. Love heals all.

“Yet you don’t believe in love,” I said. How was that possible? Most people’s cynicism toward love came from seeing it stripped down to the barest skeleton of what it once was.

“You’re fucking drenched, Butterfly.” Lust rendered my voice unrecognizable as I dipped a hand between her legs. Her head fell back against the wall, and a moan scattered on the wind when I played lazily with her clit, circling and rubbing the swollen bud until her juices slicked my fingers. “Do you like this, hmm? Being spread wide and finger fucked where anyone can see you?” No one would. And if they did, I would kill them before they could leave with memories of her naked form embedded in their brain.  Stella was mine and mine alone.  She was panting so loudly the sound almost drowned out the roar of my pulse.  I’d never lost control during sex. My previous encounters had been transactional, outlets for physical release and nothing more. With her, I was undone before we’d even begun. “I asked you a question, Stella.” The silkiness of my statement betrayed the ruthless game I played with her arousal, pulling her to the edge and withdrawing just before she tipped over the edge. “Answer me.” “I…” Stella’s pants reached a fever pitch when I pressed against a particularly sensitive spot. “I don’t…” “Wrong answer.” I collared her throat with my other hand, pinning her against the rocky wall while I pushed her legs wider with my thigh. I kept the pressure of my thumb against her clit and slid a finger inside her tight, wet heat.

“I thought it was obvious, but in case it isn’t, you’re mine, Stella.” His touch branded my skin with hot possessiveness. “I don’t want to see other women, and I sure as fuck don’t want you seeing other men.” Ice frosted the word men. “You belong with me. Exclusively. There is not a world or lifetime where that’s not true.” Emotion stung the backs of my eyes, but I managed to smile through the tightness in my chest. “Christian Harper, are you asking me out?” “Yes.” Simple, unequivocal.

“Nothing.” I shifted beneath his skeptical gaze before I admitted, “Someone groped me on my way back from the restroom.” Christian stilled. “Who?” His tone was calm, almost pleasant, but it contained something that evoked an arctic chill beneath my skin. My body betrayed the small voice warning me not to tell him. I instinctively flicked my eyes toward the bar, where the man who’d groped me was hitting on an uninterested-looking woman. Christian followed my gaze.  “I see.” His inflection didn’t change, but foreboding slithered down my spine like the cool, scaly skin of a snake. Some people burned hot when they were angry, but Christian ran cold. The quieter he got, the more people needed to worry. “It’s not a big deal,” I said anxiously. I didn’t want him doing anything that might get him into trouble or that he might regret later. “It was only a passing grab. Not worth making a scene over.” “I won’t make a scene.” Christian set his empty champagne glass on a nearby table, his face unreadable. “In fact, I’m done here. Are you ready to leave?”

A mental image of the fucker grabbing Stella’s ass flashed through my mind, and the rage resurfaced, churning like icy black waves beneath my skin. “I changed my mind.” I turned. “I’m not in a good mood after all.” The gunshot ripped through the air. Frank slumped onto the desk with a hole in the back of his head and open, lifeless eyes. I tucked the gun back into my jacket and exited into the hall, where Kage lounged against the wall. “Don’t tell me you shot him,” he said when he saw me. The office was soundproofed, but he correctly assessed my expression. “What a fucking mess.” “He pissed me off.” I checked my watch. Dammit. The only grocery store that sold Stella’s favorite salsa closed in fifteen minutes. “Clean that up for me, will you?” “I always do,” he said dryly.

It was easier for me to come when I was grinding on something versus using my fingers, and the firm pressure against my clit mixed with the filthy, sloppy sounds of the blowjob drove me higher toward release with each passing second. I was drenched and probably making a mess of his pants, but I was too lost in a fog of lust to care. “I can feel how wet your cunt is.” Christian pulled my head back so I stared straight up at him, my eyes watering from taking him so deep for so long. “Does this turn you on, hmm? Grinding against my leg while you choke on my cock?” “Mmmph.” My muffled moan of affirmation cut off in a gasp when he abruptly pulled me off him, picked me up, and pushed me against the window in one fluid motion. Desire pooled between my legs at the press of glass against my cheek and the heat of him at my back. I loved when he was like this. Rough. Demanding. A beast uncaged. Christian yanked my dress straps off my shoulders and pulled the bodice down to bare my breasts. “When you come…” He rucked the skirt up with his other hand and hooked his finger in the waistband of my underwear. “It’ll be with my cock inside your pussy, not your throat.”

“Christian, please.” His grip on my throat stole my screams and turned them into hoarse pleas. “I need...I’m going to…” I lost the rest of my sentence to another wave of pleasure when he reached around to stroke my clit. Once. Twice. Just enough to deepen the ache, but not enough to break the leash on my swelling release. “I love when you beg so sweetly for me.” He buried his face in my neck and nipped at the skin. “Do you need to come, hmm?” “Yes.” My answer spilled out in a sob. “Then be a good girl and push that pretty little cunt back on me.”

She was a living contradiction, and she’d consumed my thoughts in a way no one and nothing had before or since. The fashion blogger who spent hours putting together the perfect outfit and the volunteer who spent her free time cleaning up trash from the parks. The social media star who was glued to her phone but was always there for her friends. The introvert who lived her life in the public eye online. The calm and the chaos, the silence and the storm.

“I was fascinated,” I said. “You were an enigma, a puzzle I couldn’t solve. I didn’t understand how anyone could be…good enough to do what you did. So I looked into your background.” I couldn’t read Stella’s expression, but she didn’t say anything, so I forged on. “It started with basic background information, but it spiraled until it turned into what you saw. The more I learned about you, the more I wanted to know.” Not wanted. Needed. She was a living contradiction, and she’d consumed my thoughts in a way no one and nothing had before or since. The fashion blogger who spent hours putting together the perfect outfit and the volunteer who spent her free time cleaning up trash from the parks. The social media star who was glued to her phone but was always there for her friends. The introvert who lived her life in the public eye online. The calm and the chaos, the silence and the storm. The calm to my chaos, the silence to my storm.

“Can I tell you a secret?” Stella whispered. “When I was in the cabin, and I thought I was about to die…the person I thought about most was you.” Her words sliced me open and dug into my heart—both the part about her almost dying, and the part where she thought about me. “I’m not saying I’m one hundred percent over what you did because I’m not,” she said. “But I also understand keeping things secret and not knowing how to tell the truth. I also realized I was wrong when I compared you to Julian. You would never hurt me the way he did. And, to be honest, I…” Stella visibly swallowed. “I missed you.” The compression in my chest loosened, and my mouth softened in a genuine smile. “I can work with that.” “Also…” A ruddy flush spread across her cheeks. “I might be able to up the percentage if you give me a goodnight kiss.” Laughter rumbled in my chest. “I can definitely work with that.” I drew her closer. “I missed you too,” I added softly before pressing a gentle kiss to her mouth. I could kiss her forever, but I forced myself to pull back after the count of three. Now wasn’t the time for a hot and heavy makeup session. “That’s all you’re getting for now. You need rest.” Stella sighed. “Tease.” Despite her grumbling, she was out like a light minutes later. I tucked her closer to my chest and, after weeks of restless nights, let the soothing rhythm of her breaths finally lull me to sleep.

“What are you going to do with Julian?” I asked, sure I didn’t want to know the answer but was too curious not to ask. If it were anyone else, I’d insist they let the police handle it. However, trying to convince Christian to turn a case over to the cops would be futile, and I didn’t have the best experience with the police. With my luck, Julian would weasel his way out of a heavy sentence and be back on the streets in a few months. Christian’s eyes darkened. “Nothing he doesn’t deserve.” A chill skated down my spine at the calm lethalness of his response. I suddenly wondered, on a more visceral level, why he was wearing all-black, casual attire instead of a suit. Christian had proved he was a better man than I’d expected. But I knew with sudden, blinding clarity that he was also capable of worse things than I could imagine. Our gazes locked. My heartbeat slowed beneath the weight of his appraisal. He knew I knew, or at least I had an inkling. And he wanted to see if I would condemn him. Try to stop him. My fork grew cold in my hand. But I didn’t say a word. The chime of the doorbell broke the spell, and I instinctively glanced toward the living room. Nina must’ve answered the door because I heard the faint sounds of my friends’ voices followed by the patter of footsteps. “If you have time today…” Christian’s quiet voice drew my attention back to him. “Look in the drawer where you found the files. There’s something there for you.” The uncharacteristic uncertainty in his tone sparked a seed of curiosity and something warmer that slid through me like molten honey. My friends’ voices grew louder. Christian moved to leave, but I stopped him before he reached the doorway. “Christian.” He turned to look back at me. “Don’t give him any pieces of your soul,” I said softly. Julian made his bed, and it was time to lie in it. But Christian…I didn’t want him doing anything that would haunt him, especially if it was for me. Especially if it would break any part of him. “One of my favorite things about you,” he

“Here’s the thing.” I pressed the tip of the knife into his sternum. “I don’t like getting my hands dirty. Blood doesn’t go well with any of my clothes. But sometimes…” I dragged the knife down his torso. Blood welled and snaked down his body like thin rivulets of red. “Someone pisses me off enough that I make an exception.” I paused at the soft flesh of his belly, then rammed the blade in so hard he would’ve collapsed had he not been strung up. An inhuman scream ripped from his throat, followed by a second scream when I yanked the knife out. “Here’s the thing, Julian.” I continued like nothing happened. “She’ll never be yours. She was always mine. And your biggest mistake…” I dropped the bloodied knife on the table and selected a meat cleaver. “Was hurting someone who was mine.”

“Do you want to know what you taste like?” I slid two fingers inside her and lifted my head so I could see her. Stella gazed down at me, her eyes half-lidded with desire and bright with clear, pure trust. It undid me. My cock was so hard it felt like it would split open from the pressure, but the walls around my heart had crumbled, baring the soft, beating organ to her every whim and desire. “Like honey and spices.” I pushed my fingers deeper. She was so tight I could feel her stretching around me, inch by inch, until I was knuckles deep inside her. “Like sweetness and sin.” In. Out. Slowly and thoroughly, letting her feel every glide of friction. A full-body shudder rolled through her. “You taste…” I removed my fingers and lowered my head. “Like mine.” A keening cry echoed through the room as Stella’s body bowed off the table. Her muscles went taut, vibrating with the force of her orgasm as she came on my tongue. Desire burned up the fuel in my veins, but I took my time, leisurely savoring every drop while wave after wave rolled through her. Finally, her cries subsided into a dazed whimper, and she sprawled, loose-limbed and sated, on the table. “My favorite part of the meal,” I said lazily. “You were right.” I gave her clit one final, languid lick. “I just needed to find the right dessert.”

My eyes flew open. Kai had moved from his previous spot. He was now seated on the bench, his body scant inches from mine. I hit the wrong key. The discordant note jarred my bones, and though I quickly corrected myself, I couldn’t lose myself in the music anymore. I was too busy drowning in awareness, in the scent of the woods after a rainstorm and the way Kai’s gaze burned a hole in my cheek. Yesterday, I’d played like no one was watching. Today, I played like the whole world was watching, except it wasn’t the whole world. It was one man. I finished the étude, frustration chafing beneath my skin. Kai watched me without a word, his expression unreadable save for a tiny pinch between his brows. “You distracted me,” I said before he could state the obvious. The pinch loosened, revealing a glimmer of amusement. “How so?” “You know how.” The amusement deepened. “I was merely sitting. I didn’t say or do a single thing.” “You’re sitting too close.” I cast a pointed glance at the sliver of black leather seating between us. “It’s an obvious intimidation tactic.” “Ah, yes. The secret art of sitting too closely. I should contact the CIA and inform them of this groundbreaking tactic.”

I dragged my attention back to the conversation at hand. “So I was right about all the lessons. Predictable.” The words came out more breathless than I’d intended, but I masked it with a bright smile. “Unless you also have some exciting hobby I don’t know about. Do you tame wild horses in your free time? BASE jump off the top of that tower in Dubai? Host orgies in your private library?” Embers smoldered, then cooled. “I’m afraid not.” Kai’s voice could’ve melted butter. “I don’t like sharing.”

Get it together, Isa. You’re conversing in a piano room, for God’s sake, not bungee jumping off the Macau Tower.

“Twelve,” she said, her tone sweet enough to induce a cavity. “I’m happy to lend it to you. It might help loosen you up so you don’t die of a stress-induced heart attack before age forty.” I’d much rather have you loosen me up instead. The thought was so sudden, so absurd and unexpected, it robbed me of a timely response.

“Ex-girlfriend?” Isabella asked as we walked to our table. “Childhood neighbor.” “Future girlfriend then.” A small arch of my brow. “That’s quite a leap to make.” “But I’m not wrong. She seems like the type of woman you’d date.” Isabella took her seat next to Vivian, directly across from me. Her words contained no judgment, only a stark matter-of-factness that rankled more than it should’ve. “You seem quite interested in my love life.” I snapped my napkin open and laid it across my lap. “Why is that?” She snorted. “I’m not interested. I was just making an observation.” “About my love life.” “I’m not sure you have a love life,” Isabella said. “I’ve never heard you talk about women or seen you at the club with a date.” “I like to keep my private life private, but it’s nice to know you’ve been keeping such close tabs on my alleged lack of female company.” My mouth curved, an automatic response to her adorable sputter before I wrangled it into a straight line. No smiling. No thinking anything she does is adorable. “You have an overinflated sense of your own importance.” Isabella canted her chin higher. “And FYI, the private life excuse only works for celebrities and politicians. I promise there are fewer people interested in your paramours than you think.” “Good to know.” This time, my smile broke free of its restraints at her tangible indignation. “Congratulations on being one of those lucky few.” “You’re insufferable.” “But imagine how much more insufferable I’d be if I were a celebrity or politician.”

“I don’t know what you mean,” Kai said, his tone mild. “I simply reminded him of the club rules, per my duty as a member of the managing committee.” A smile edged onto my lips. “Taxing work.” “Positively grueling. But I try my best.” “So grueling you missed your standing appointment here last Thursday?” The words fell out of their own accord. I wished I could snatch them back the instant they left my mouth, but it was too late. The remnants of Kai’s stony expression melted, revealing a flicker of warm pleasure that had my toes curling in my boots. “Keeping tabs on me again, Isabella?” The velvety way he said my name was almost indecent, conjuring images of lazy afternoons and silken sheets. Of hands sliding up my thighs and kisses trailing down my neck, his mouth doing wicked things to my body while he thrust inside me. Over and over, until— Fuck. Heat ignited between my thighs. My fingers curled around the counter, but I shrugged off his question and forced myself not to break his knowing stare. “Only so I can avoid you. Anyone who translates classics into Latin for fun terrifies me.” A laugh crinkled the corners of his eyes, and my pulse jumped in response. It was turning into a Pavlovian situation at this point. Anytime Kai did something, my traitorous body reacted like it’d been struck by lightning. “I’m happy to report there’ll be no translations today, but if it makes you feel better, I work on genre fiction too. I translated a Nora Roberts novel once. It was a refreshing change of pace.” “It doesn’t, but thank you for that detail. Come back to me when you’ve translated dinosaur erotica.” Kai blinked. “I’m sorry?” “Never mind.” I didn’t want to push him too far, too fast. The poor man would probably have a heart attack if he discovered some of the books floating outside his literary bubble. “You know, you never told me why you came in on a Monday the other week.” It’d been nagging at me since it happened. I had more important things to worry about, but not knowing the reason bothered the hell out of me, like trying and failing to remember the name of a song that sat on the tip of my tongue. Kai recovered admirably fast from my dinosaur erotica quip. “Does it matter?” “Maybe not in the grand scheme of things, but I’m a bartender, which means I’m also a good sounding board and therapist.” I poured his scotch and slid the glass across the counter. “A few days ago, I consoled a ramen noodle heiress because she couldn’t find her driver in the rain and had to use her hundred-thousand-dollar handbag as a makeshift umbrella. The worst part was…” I lowered my voice. “The bag was a super special limited edition, and the designer refused to make her another one.” “Ah, the classic handbag dilemma,” Kai said sympathetically. “What a tragedy.” “The gravest kind. We should alert the Red Cross.” “You call, I’ll email. We should cover all the bases for a case of this magnitude.” My smile blossomed into a full-fledged grin.

“Now all I have to do is finish my own,” I said. “Then I can quit and kick Victor Black in the balls without worrying about losing my job.” Kai’s smile notched up another inch, but his eyes remained serious behind his glasses. “You’ll finish it.” He said it with such unflinching certainty that my heart stilled for a split second. “How do you know?” I hated the note of self-doubt in my voice. I’d always been the social butterfly, the person who cheered my friends on and pushed them to step outside their comfort zone. But there were nights when I lay awake, stripped of all confidence and pretense, wondering who the hell I was and what I was doing. Had I chosen the wrong path? Was there even a right path for me, or was I destined to drift through life like an aimless ghost? No meaning, no purpose, just day after day of routine and drudgery. A life wasted on bad decisions and short-term highs.

“To stepping out of comfort zones.” We tipped our heads back and downed the drinks at the same time. The fiery burn of bourbon scorched its way into my stomach. It tasted awful, but the resulting buzz was worth temporarily murdering my taste buds. “Jesus.” Kai grimaced. “What did they put in this? Battery acid?” “Don’t ask. Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.” I dragged him back to the dance floor. He rubbed his free hand over his face. “You’re going to be the death of me one day.”

My first kiss in two years. It should’ve felt strange or at least a little uncomfortable, but it didn’t. Instead, it felt completely, perfectly right. My bones liquefied. If he hadn’t been holding me up, I would’ve melted right there in the middle of the dance floor. There was no denying it. Rigid, proper Kai Young, of the posh accent and boring hobbies, was an incredible kisser.

“Am I wrong?” “I wouldn’t know. Like I said, you scared him off before I could confirm how—” Her sentence broke off in a gasp when I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her to me. “Do you think you would’ve enjoyed your time with him, Isabella?” I asked softly. “Would you have screamed for him like you did for me when I had my fingers buried inside your sweet little pussy? When you rode my hand until it was soaked with your release? I can still hear your cries, love. Every damn second of every day.”

A shiver rippled through her. Her head fell back when my lips skimmed down to her earlobe and nipped. “Kai…” The breathy sound of my name on Isabella’s lips snapped whatever control I had left. Lust surged through me, sweeping every piece of logic and rationality aside. Few things in life were certain, but this I knew—if I didn’t have her soon, and if she didn’t want me as desperately as I wanted her, I would fucking die. “Go upstairs and tell your friends you’re leaving.” I curled my hand around the back of her neck, my voice so low and dark I hardly recognized it. “You have five minutes, sweetheart, or you’ll find out firsthand that I’m not always the gentleman you think

Kai gripped my thighs to hold me in place while he withdrew. Slowly, until just the tip of his cock was inside me. Then he thrust back in. Deeper. Faster. Harder. Any remaining coherence shattered as he fucked me against the wall with so much force it rattled my bones. Everything blurred. My nails dug into his shoulders as squeals and whimpers poured out of me, mingling with his grunts and the deep, rhythmic bass of the music. My entire body was on sensory overload. No matter how much I took, it wasn’t enough. More. I need more. Kai’s teeth grazed against my neck. “Still think I’m boring?”

“You know…” He smoothed my dress back down over my thighs with a thoughtful expression. “This might be the longest I’ve heard you go without talking.” His chest rumbled with laughter when I snapped out of my sex-induced trance and gave him a mock glare. “Don’t act so smug,” I said. “It’s simply the result of having sex for the first time in two years. You’re not the sex god you think you are.” It was a blatant lie, but I couldn’t let his ego inflate any further lest he float off into space.

Tears leaked from my eyes, and I bucked like an unbroken filly, wild and out of control. Heart pounding, fingers clawing, mouth falling open in a reckless cry that abruptly cut off when he slammed his hand over my mouth. The muffled remnants of my scream leaked around his palm. “Shh.” Kai’s voice was soft, almost gentle in contrast with the merciless way he fucked. “We don’t want someone to come in and see your sweet little pussy getting wrecked by my cock, do we?” The unexpectedly vulgar words, delivered in such an aristocratic accent, tipped me over the edge. “God, Kai.” My orgasm tore through me, unfolding in wave after wave of mindless, toe-curling pleasure. The world blanked in one suspended, breathless moment before I crashed back into reality. The smooth, deep thrusts grew erratic. His breath hissed between his teeth, and I clung to him, too dazed to do anything more than hold on when he finally came with a loud groan. Our chests heaved as we held each other in the comedown. If it weren’t for the wall braced against my back, we might’ve both collapsed to the floor. Oh my God. I tried to speak, but my vocal cords wouldn’t work. I was too exhausted and satiated. Eventually, our heartbeats returned to normal. Kai withdrew and gently set me on my feet before disposing of his condom and straightening our clothing. “You know…” He smoothed my dress back down over my thighs with a thoughtful expression. “This might be the longest I’ve heard you go without talking.” His chest rumbled with laughter when I snapped out of my sex-induced trance and gave him a mock glare. “Don’t act so smug,” I said. “It’s simply the result of having sex for the first time in two years.

Unbelievable. “Of course. I couldn’t very well have someone walking in on us.” “Because photos of the Young heir engaging in carnal activities at a bar would put his CEO candidacy at risk.” “No. Because if anyone saw you like that, I’d have to kill them.” He said it so simply, so casually, it took a moment for the words to sink in. Once they did, the air vanished from my lungs. It suddenly hit me that I’d had sex with Kai Young. In the back of a bar, no less. If anyone told me I’d be in this situation mere weeks ago, I would’ve laughed in their face. Now my man ban lay in pieces at our feet, and I was in danger of getting caught in the post-sex trap, a.k.a. reading more into the situation than what was there. Old Isabella would’ve gone along with it and taken whatever scraps she could get. Sometimes, ignorance was bliss, especially when you were young, inexperienced, and desperate for love or some approximation thereof. But I’d walked that road, and it’d led me somewhere I never wanted to visit again. So even though I hated being the person who initiated serious talks right after sex, I cut straight to the point. Our relationship was too complicated to let things linger without clearing the air. “So what happens next?” My heart pounded so hard it almost bruised. A quizzical line formed between Kai’s brows. “This.” I gestured between us. “Us. What are we doing?” “Recovering from excellent orgasms, I presume.” The full weight of disappointment anchored my stomach. “You’re too smart to play dumb,” I said, hurt by his cavalier attitude. I’d broken a years-long vow to myself for him, and he couldn’t take me seriously enough for one meaningful conversation. Kai’s smile gradually dissolved. His eyes searched my face; whatever he saw made him wince. “You’re right. I’m sorry,” he said quietly. “But I thought you knew.” This time, I was the confused one. “Knew what?” “That there’s no going back after this.” His admission was a warm breath on my skin. “You should’ve never

“I see that.” Amusement edged out my surprise. Her free hand carried a plate piled so high with hors d’oeuvres it resembled the Leaning Tower of Pisa. “Are you sure you picked up enough food, love?” A faint wash of pink edged Isabella’s cheeks and the tip of her nose. “As a matter of fact, no. I was just about to get more when someone got in my way.” “How rude of them.” “Very. No one has manners these days.” “A sign of our imminent societal collapse, no doubt.” My mouth curved into a lazy, appreciative smile as I tipped my chin down. “On a less ominous note, you look beautiful. It’s a good thing you didn’t put that on before I left, or neither of us would be standing here right now.”

my arms around his neck. “What type of game?” He sounded remarkably calm, but his breathing accelerated when I pressed my mouth to his jaw. “The one where you’re not allowed to touch me until you come.” I kissed my way down his neck to the hollow of his throat. He smelled so delicious I wanted to wrap him around me like a blanket. “If you do, you lose, and you have to read only books of my choosing for a month.” Kai was so stressed about DigiStream and work. Hopefully this would loosen him up. “And if I win?” The words turned smoky in the thickening air. “If you win…” I hooked my fingers around his suspenders and straightened. “I’ll do whatever you want for twenty-four hours.” His eyes gleamed with dark interest. “Whatever I want?” A streak of fear mixed with a potent shot of arousal. “Yes.” It wasn’t an offer I would’ve given anyone else, but I trusted him. He wouldn’t take advantage of the situation. Besides, I had no intention of losing. Kai leaned back. A shutter fell over his expression as he observed me with the detached interest of a professor examining a student or a king observing a peasant. Do your best, his eyes challenged.

Spots danced in front of my vision, and I finally pulled back with a gasp. Oxygen flooded my lungs, making me light-headed, but it evaporated again at Kai’s next words. “I didn’t say you could pull back.” His voice carried a preternatural calm. “Keep sucking, Isabella.” The command poured through me like molten lava. I was supposed to be the one calling the shots, but my resistance disintegrated before it even fully formed. I obeyed, taking him to the hilt again. “Fuck.” His groan ran straight to the ache building between my legs. “Just like that, sweetheart. You take my cock so beautifully.”

Kai tightened his grip on my hair before releasing it. “Pick a book.” “What?” I blinked, disoriented by the sudden and baffling change in topic. “A book.” He nodded at the leather-bound tomes lining the shelves. “Pick one.” Curiosity compelled me to select a book at random. “Open it.” I opened it to a page in the middle. Coincidentally, I’d chosen Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, one of the few classics I enjoyed. “Now bend over the couch and spread your legs.” My confusion ramped up even as heat crawled through my blood, lighting me on fire. In this position, I was bared to him, the tiny scraps of my lingerie doing little to hide my swollen arousal or the juices drenching my thighs. “We’re going to play a new game.” Kai stepped behind me. “It’s simple. If you can read a full page out loud without stopping or stuttering, I’ll let you come.”

“Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested…” The feather brushed a particularly sensitive spot, and my sentence trailed off with a whimper. Tiny shivers rippled down my spine. They turned into a shocked yelp when Kai’s palm landed on my bare ass with a sharp slap. There was a breath-rattling sting of pain, followed by a slow bloom of heat. “Start over,” he ordered with the stern command of an unforgiving professor. I did, but I never made it more than two paragraphs before I paused or stuttered. Every mistake earned me another slap until my eyes welled with tears and I squirmed with mindless abandon. Pain and pleasure blurred into one delicious, agonizing burn. I was barely paying attention to the text anymore. It got to the point where every word out of my mouth alternated with a hard spank. “Please,” I sobbed. “I can’t…I need…” “Yes, you can.” Kai’s voice was as unyielding as his punishment. He shoved two fingers into my dripping, exposed cunt. Oh God. My insides knotted; my breaths came out in heavy, whining pants. So close. If he would only move. I would…I could… “Unless you’re messing up on purpose.” He kept pushing until he was knuckles deep inside me. “Does this turn you on, Isabella? Getting bent over and punished like a dirty schoolgirl?” “No. Yes. I don’t know,” I moaned, too dizzy and turned on to think properly. Tears leaked down my cheeks when he twisted and curled his fingers inside. I bucked again, but it was no use. I couldn’t get enough friction to light the simmering fuse in my stomach. “I need to come…let me come…please.” But no matter how much I begged and pleaded, Kai refused to yield. “You can come once you complete your assignment. That’s the game.” He withdrew his hand and resumed his exquisite, feathery torture. “You like those, don’t you? Now start from the top.” I didn’t know how, but eventually, I mustered enough willpower and presence of mind to read the page without messing up. The words poured out, faster and faster, before reaching a breathless crescendo on the last sentence. Kai’s fingers slammed inside me again. His thumb pressed against my clit, and his other hand delivered a sharp, final slap on my ass.

Parker at Valhalla for hiring her, Dante and Vivian for always forcing me into the same room as her, her damn parents for giving birth to her. If it weren’t for them, I wouldn’t have met Isabella, and I wouldn’t have a hole the size of Jupiter in my chest. I’d played, replayed, and dissected every second of our relationship until the memories bled out of me and I was empty. And when it was all gone—the anger, the hurt, the pain—the only thing left was a dark, gaping numbness. I didn’t blame Isabella for what she did. Not anymore. The past month had taken a toll on both of us, and she’d been reeling from her visit home. The only thing I hated more than being apart from her was the knowledge of how poorly she viewed herself. She had no idea how incredible she was, and it killed me. I tucked my

“I love you, Isabella Valencia.” Simple and raw, stripped of all pretense except for the naked truth that had been staring me in the face all this time. “Every single part of you, from your laugh to your humor to the way you can’t stop talking about condoms.” One of those laughs I loved so much slipped out, thick with emotion. A smile flashed across my face before I sobered again. “You think you’re broken, but I wish you could see yourself the way I see you. Smart. Strong. Beautiful. Imperfect by your own standards but so wonderfully perfect for me.”

We’d started the day with piano performances in honor of Isabella’s father. She’d played a Chopin piece while I followed it up with the “Hammerklavier.” My rendition had come a long way since the stunning realization that Isabella could outplay me years ago. After much practice, I’d perfected it to the point where even her lolo greeted its conclusion with tears in his eyes. Isabella insisted I owed my improvement not to practice but to finding the thing I’d been “lacking.” Heart. Which was ridiculous. Practice made perfect, not heart. But I kept her close to me anyway.

Major instruments of social stability. Standard men and women; in uniform batches. The whole of a small factory staffed with the products of a single bokanovskified egg. ‘Ninety-six identical twins working ninety-six identical machines!’ The voice was almost tremulous with enthusiasm. ‘You really know where you are. For the first time in history.’ He quoted the planetary motto. ‘Community, Identity, Stability.’ Grand words. ‘If we could bokanovskify indefinitely the whole problem would be solved.’

I stop in front of a library shelf. Scattered between the engineering tomes I notice a handful of personal items. They humanize Levi in a way I’m not ready for: a child’s drawing of a black cat; a few bobbleheads from sci-fi movies; two framed pictures. One is Levi and another tall, dark-haired man free-climbing a rock formation. The other, a woman. Very beautiful. Long, dark blond hair. Young, probably Levi’s age. She smiles at the camera, holding a toddler with a full head of dark curls. The frame is clearly homemade, buttons and shells and sticks glued together. My heart lurches, heavy. I knew he had a child. I’ve even turned this piece of information around in my head several times since finding out. And I’m not surprised that he’s married. He doesn’t wear a ring, but that doesn’t mean anything— I often do wear a ring, and I’m most definitely not married. Honestly, I’m not sure why this hits me so hard. I certainly have no personal stake in Levi’s romantic life, and I don’t usually go about feeling jealous when people find themselves happily paired. But the domesticity that the picture conjures, just like the soft, intimate tone his voice took last week when he answered the call . . . very clearly, Levi has a home.

“Listen. What you said yesterday . . .” He must have stepped inside, because the background noise is gone. His voice is rich and deep in my ear. I think I can actually hear him swallow. “There is no other neuroscientist I’d want to do this project with. Not a single one.” It’s a blow to the sternum. The words knock the air out of my lungs, and a weird, nonsensical, untimely thought crosses my mind: it’s not that surprising that this broody, reserved man snagged himself a beautiful bride. Not if he’s capable of saying things like this.

“No.” He shakes his head. “BLINK has to happen now. If it’s delayed there’s a chance that I won’t be in charge, or that the original prototype will be modified.” He sounds so uncompromising, I wonder if this is his pick-up-your-toys-and-go-to-bed dad voice. It sure seems effective. If I end up having kids, I hope I can pull off something this authoritative.

“But of course I know. How could I not know when you’ve been so relentlessly cold, arrogant, and unapproachable.” I stand, anger bubbling up my throat. “For years you have avoided me, refused to collaborate with me without valid reasons, denied me even minimally polite conversation, treated me as though I was repulsive and inferior—you even told my fiancé that he should marry someone else, but of course you don’t despise me, Levi.” His Adam’s apple bobs. He stares at me like that, stricken, disconcerted, like I just hit him with a polo mallet—when all I’ve done is tell the truth. My eyes sting. I bite my lip to keep the tears at bay, but my stupid body betrays me once again and I’m crying, I’m crying in front of him, and I hate him. I’m not mad at him—I hate him.

Oh my God. Oh. My. God. “He’s a vegan,” I mutter to myself. “He is.” I look up. Levi is staring at me with a puzzled, patient expression, and I have no idea how to tell him that this is, like, the tenth thing we have in common. Sci-fi and cats and science and obviously men’s deodorants and who knows what else. It’s so incredibly upsetting to me, I can’t even imagine how much he’d hate it if he knew. I toy with the idea of telling him, but he doesn’t deserve it. He’s been very nice today. Instead I just clear my throat. “Um, me too.” “I figured. When you . . . scolded me. About the donut.” “Oh, God. I’d forgotten about that.” I bury my face in my hands. “I’m sorry. So sorry. Believe it or not, I’m usually not a deranged asshole who scares her colleagues away from plant-based products.”

her in a dream, or if she stole it from Teen Vogue, but here they are: There is the cute type, which consists of guys who are attractive in a nonthreatening, accessible way, as a combination of their nice looks and captivating personalities. Tim falls into this group, just like Guy and most male scientists—including, I suspect, Pierre Curie. Come to think of it, all the guys who ever hit on me do, perhaps because I’m small, and dress quirky, and try to be friendly. If I were a dude, I’d be a Cute Guy™; Cute Guys™ recognize that at some elemental level, and they make passes at me. Then there’s the handsome type. According to Annie, this category is a bit of a waste. The Handsome Guy™ has the kind of face you see in movie trailers and perfume ads, geometrically perfect and objectively amazing, but there’s something inaccessible about him. Those guys are so dreamy, they’re almost abstract. They need something to anchor them to reality—a personality quirk, a flaw, a circumscribed interest—otherwise they’ll float away in a bubble of boredom. Of course, society doesn’t exactly encourage Handsome Guys™ to develop brilliant personalities, so I tend to concur with Annie: they’re useless. Last but not least, the Sexy Guys™. Annie would go on and on about how Levi is the epitome of the Sexy Guy™, but I’d like to formally object. In fact, I don’t even acknowledge the existence of this category. It’s preposterous, the idea that there are men you can’t help yourself from being attracted to. Men who give you the tingles, men you can’t stop thinking about, men who pop up in your brain like flashes of light after stimulation of the occipital cortex. Men who are physical, elemental, primordial. Masculine. Present. Solid. Sounds fake, right?

You sweet summer child.” I point at myself. Tonight I’m wearing a nose stud, galaxy leggings, and a white tank top. My purple hair is loose on my shoulders.

SHMAC: I know what she smells like. This little freckle on her neck when she pulls up her hair. Her upper lip is a little plumper than the lower. The curve of her wrist, when she holds a pen. It’s wrong, really wrong, but I know the shape of her. I go to sleep thinking about it, and then I wake up, go to work, and she is there, and it’s impossible. I tell her stuff I know she’ll agree to, just to hear her hum back at me. It’s like hot water down my fucking spine. She’s married. She’s brilliant. She trusts me, and all I think about is taking her to my office, stripping her, doing unspeakable things to her. And I want to tell her. I want to tell her that she’s luminous, she’s so bright in my mind, sometimes I can’t focus. Sometimes I forget why I came into the room. I’m distracted. I want to push her against a wall, and I want her to push back. I want to go back in time and punch her stupid husband on the day I met him and then travel back to the future and punch him again. I want to buy her flowers, food, books. I want to hold her hand, and I want to lock her in my bedroom. She’s everything I ever wanted and I want to inject her into my veins and also to never see her again. There’s nothing like her and these feelings, they are fucking intolerable. They were half-asleep while she was gone, but now she’s here and my body thinks it’s a fucking teenager and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do. There is nothing I can do, so I’ll just . . . not.

“How did you two end up working together, anyway?” Everyone tunes in after that. All eyes are on Levi and me. Sadly, Levi is chewing on a potato wedge. So I say, “It’s an NIH-NASA collab, Mike.” “Oh yeah, right.” Mike looks a bit buzzed, but he takes another sip of his punch. He was a third year when I joined the lab. Also: he was a shithead. “But, like, how are you two managing it? Levi, do you bleach your brain after every meeting, or . . . ?” My cheeks burn. Some people chuckle, a couple laugh outright, and others look away, clearly embarrassed. Sam frowns, and from the corner of my eye I see Tim smirk. I wish I had a witty comeback, but I’m too mortified by the fact that Levi finding me disgusting is still the lab’s funniest inside joke. I open my mouth without knowing what to say, and— “We’re doing great,” Levi tells Mike, his tone a mix of big-dick calm and I could kill a man with a beach ball. He leisurely puts his arm on the back of my chair, and plucks a grape from my plate. A deafening silence falls at the table. Everyone is looking at us. Everyone. “What about you, Mike?” Levi asks without bothering to look up from my food. “I heard there were problems with your tenure packet. How’s that coming along?” “Oh, um . . .” “Yeah.

He leisurely puts his arm on the back of my chair, and plucks a grape from my plate. A deafening silence falls at the table. Everyone is looking at us. Everyone. “What about you, Mike?” Levi asks without bothering to look up from my food. “I heard there were problems with your tenure packet. How’s that coming along?” “Oh, um . . .” “Yeah. I thought so.” Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. I guess Levi’s done eating his potatoes?

“Bee, I . . . I’m not sure I should be telling you this. But hiding things from you hasn’t worked out in our favor. And you asked me to be honest.” “I did.” I study him, unsure where he’s heading. “When you and I first met,” he says slowly, carefully weighing his words, “I had issues talking to people. About certain things.” “Like . . . aphasia?” He smiles, shaking his head. “Not quite.” I try to think back to fifth-year Levi—he seemed larger than life, indomitable, whip-smart. Then again, Annie seemed invincible, and I apparently seemed effortless. Grad school really screwed us up, didn’t it? “I never noticed it. You were capable, self-assured, and got along with most people.” I mull it over. “Except for me, of course.” “I’m not explaining myself well. I had no issues talking to normal people. My issues were . . . with you.” I scowl. “Are you saying that I’m not normal?” He laughs silently. “You’re not normal. Not to me.” “What does that mean?” I turn in the seat to face him, not sure why he’s insulting me again, after two days of being incredibly lovely. Is he having a relapse? “Just because you thought I was ugly or unlikable, it doesn’t mean that I wasn’t normal—” “I never thought of you as ugly.” His hands tighten even more around the wheel. “Never.” “Come on. The way you always acted was—” “The opposite, in fact.” I frown. “What do you even—” Oh. Oh. Oh. Does he mean that—? No. Impossible. He wouldn’t. Would he? Even if we . . . He can’t possibly be implying that. Can he? “I—” My mind goes blank for a split second—complete, utter white-out void. I’m suddenly frozen numb, so I lean forward to turn off the AC. I have no clue how to answer him. How to stop my heart from beating out of my throat. “Do you mean that you . . . ?” He nods. “You didn’t . . . you didn’t even let me finish the sentence.” “Whatever you’re imagining, from the tamest to the most . . . inappropriate thoughts, that’s probably where my mind was at.” He swallows visibly. I watch his throat move. “You were always in my head. And I could never get you out.” I turn to the window, scarlet. There’s no universe in which I’m parsing his words correctly. This is a misunderstanding. I’m having some neurological event. And all I want to ask is, What about now? Am I still in your head? “You always stared at me like I was some obscene monstrosity.” “I tried not to stare, but . . . it wasn’t easy.” “No. No, you—the dress. You hated me in that dress. My blue dress, the one with—” “I know what dress, Bee.” “You know because you hated it,” I say in a panic. “I didn’t hate it.” His words are quiet. “It just took me by surprise.” “My Target dress took you by surprise?” “No, Bee. My . . . reaction to you wearing it did.” I shake my head. This cannot be true. “You wouldn’t even sit next to me.” “It was hard to think when you were close.” His voice is husky. “No. No! You refused to collaborate with me. You told Tim he should marry someone better, you avoided me like the bubonic plague—” “Tim warned me off.” I turn to him. “What?” “He asked me to back off and leave you alone.” “He . . .” I cover my mouth and imagine Tim, very average- sized Tim, confronting Levi, a not-so-gentle bison. “How did he . . . ?” “He told me you knew that I was . . . interested. That I was making you uncomfortable. That you found me unpleasant.” Levi’s throat works. “He asked me to avoid you as much as I could. And I did. In a way, it was easier.” “Easier?” He shrugs with a self-deprecating smile. “Just . . . wanting and not having, it can get unbearable. Quickly so.” He wets his lips. “I didn’t know what to say anyway. You have to understand, people don’t talk about the things they feel where I come from. I got really tongue-tied around you—leading you and everyone else to believe that I despised you, apparently. I . . . I had no idea. I owe you an apology for that.” I can’t believe what he’s saying. I can’t believe what I’m hearing. I can’t believe Tim knew and successfully manipulated Levi into staying away while he screwed his way through Pitt’s student body. “Why are you telling this to me? Why now?” He looks at me, serious and earnest like only Levi Ward could ever be, and something surges into me. Something painful and delightful and confusing. Something breathtaking and spellbinding, rich and frightening. Not a fully formed feeling, but an early draft of it. It’s on the back of my throat and on the tip of my tongue. I want to get a grasp of its taste before it’s gone.

Levi and I watch them walk away in the late afternoon sunlight. When they’re just little dots on the street, he tells me, “That was excellent practice for when we’ll have teenage daughters.” My heart skips. He doesn’t mean together, idiot. “They’re young.

“Okay, then . . .” He shrugs, and before I know what’s going on I’m in his arms and he’s spinning me around, my legs wrapped around his waist and his hands on my thighs. I laugh. I laugh like I’m happy. What a weekend. I’m a feather. I’m invincible. I’m doing science. I’m having fun. I’m building things, useful, important things. I’m facing demons from my past. I’m being whirled around when I’m too tired to do it myself. I’m bubbling, exhilarated, brave. I’m the most myself and not myself at all. I’m tightening my hands around Levi’s neck, and when he slows down I’m asking him, “Are you going to kiss me?” No idea where that came from. But I’m not sorry it’s out there. His smile doesn’t falter, but he shakes his head. “I don’t think so,” he says quietly. Strands of purple hair brush against his forehead. His cheeks. We are close, so close. He smells so good. “Why?” “Because I’m not sure you want me to kiss you.” “Oh.” I nod. My hair tickles his nose. He scrunches it, and I laugh. “What if I told you that I do? Would you kiss me then?” “I still don’t think so,” he says calmly. Seriously. My smile fades. Oh, shit. Shit, I made a mess. “You don’t want to?” My voice is small, insecure. He shakes his head. “That’s not it.” It must be. What else? “Right.” I’ve been in his arms for a while, but suddenly I feel self-conscious. He’s not okay with this. He used to be attracted to me, but not anymore. I’m overstepping. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to go too far.” “You don’t understand, Bee.” A small smile. Our foreheads touch, his skin warm against mine. I really, really want a kiss from this man. I want it bad enough to burn. “You can’t go too far.” “Then why . . . ?” His eyes flutter closed. His lips move closer. “I’m terrified that you won’t go far enough.”

she’s busy having a real, true, actual, honest-to-God good kiss. The best kiss. It has to do with how slow it starts. With the way Levi and I breathe against each other for a moment, just breathe and taste the air between us. It should feel ridiculous, but there’s something unique about how he looks at my mouth from lowered eyelashes. Wrapped around him like I am, I can feel his pounding heartbeat, the heat of his skin, and suddenly I’m not scared anymore. He wants this—he wants me. I know it in the liquid, messy warmth of my abdomen, in the red spreading over his cheekbones, in his breathing, even faster and louder than mine. “Bee.” The tension stretches so unbearably tight, we might as well be on different sides of the world. So I close the distance, and then it’s not slow anymore. It’s hard and fast and open-mouthed. Wet and pressing and half bites. It’s messy, the least smooth kiss of my life—but maybe it’s not a kiss at all. Just two people trying to be as close as possible. His hands are sliding up my ass. My nails are in his scalp. He grunts choppy, surprised praise into my throat—“Yeah. Yeah.”—licks the dip of my collarbone, and I’m on fire, half a minute of this and I’m already aflame, pulsating with want and need. I have no brakes: I grind myself helplessly against him, my nipples hard against his chest, his hard abs the perfect slate for my core to rub on. “You are so—” He groans deep, like he’s halfway to insane. I’m too busy desperately seeking friction to even try to keep up with my end of the kiss, but it’s okay. He’s got me. His large palm comes up, wraps around my neck, angles my head sharply, just so. His tongue is inside my mouth, pressing against mine, and . . . Dirty. This is not a kiss—this is dirty. Obscene. He pushes me against the wall, and I push back, and back, and back, like there can be no air between us. His hand under my shirt is possessive, confi-dent, so large that it completely spans my rib cage, and I arch up, swallowing a whimper in the back of my throat. My head is spinning, my body is melting, I can hear bells, and— Not bells. A phone. Ringing. It slowly penetrates the thick haze of Levi mouthing my breasts, leaving a wet trail over my T-shirt— God oh God. “Your phone,” I whisper, forcing myself to still my hips. It’s the loudest my voice will go. Then one of his hands slips inside the back of my panties, and he starts grinding me up and down on his abs, and I forget what I meant to say. It’s the exact spot, the exact rhythm I’d been trying to reach. He learned it, and he’s helping me keep it up, fingers digging into the flesh of my ass. A perfect thrust. He growls, and I whimper at the spear of pleasure. My eyes roll in the back of my head, and . . . Yes. Right against— Yes. There. “Levi,” I gasp. “Your phone—do you maybe want to—oh— pick up?” Or we can just continue until the ache disappears. Yes, that would be lovely. And stopping would be unbearable. Is that his cock rubbing against my ass? No. Impossible. No one’s that big, right? The phone is still ringing. I’m all about ignoring it, but Levi— I realize that Levi is not ignoring it. Levi is making his way under my shorts, sucking on the spot under my ear, and not even hearing it. “Levi.” He doesn’t quite snap out of it. He doesn’t pull back, doesn’t move his mouth from my skin, but he stops. His grip tightens around me. A child, reluctant to let go of a favorite toy. “Your phone. Do you want to . . . ?” His eyes are glassy. His hands not fully steady as he lets go of me, gingerly, with difficulty. I watch him try to collect himself for long seconds before he picks up. “Ward.” He is winded, chest moving up and down. He palms his erection like it hurts, all the while staring at me, me, only me.

For long moments he just looks at me, eyes full of beautiful, undecipherable green things. My throat constricts, my stomach twists, and I want to tell him that I’m sorry, that it’s okay, that I know he made a mistake, that we never need to talk about this, never again. But before I can say anything, he cups my cheek and leans down to kiss me once more. This time it’s sweet, slow, savoring. Patient. This time it’s lingering and gentle—everything our other kiss wasn’t. I want to try them all. All the kisses Levi Ward is capable of, I want to sample them like fine wine.

But my head has cooled off, I’m not a horny black hole of sexual tension anymore, and I can see how dumb it was. A stupid idea. Three out of ten, would not do again. Plus, I have other concerns.

.” I stop. Levi is staring at me open-mouthed. “I have hummingbird shit on my face, don’t I?” He keeps staring. “Do you have a tissue?” I look around the cabin. “Or even a piece of paper—” “No. No, you don’t . . .” He shakes his head, lost for words. “What’s wrong?” “You . . .” He swallows. “. . . I?” “The dress. You wore . . . the dress.” I glance at myself. Oh. Yes. I did wear my Target dress. “I thought you said you didn’t really hate it?” “And I don’t.” He swallows. “I really don’t.” I take a better look at him and realize the way he’s staring. Which is . . . “Oh.” My heartbeat picks up. “Can I kiss you?” he asks, and I could fall in love with this hesitant, shy version of Levi Ward—the same man who nibbled my throat awake at three a.m. to say that he’d die if he couldn’t fuck me again. I let him, enthusiastically. Just like I let him kiss me now, until we’re making out like teenagers, deep, fingers holding my neck, tongues stroking, his weight pressing me into the seat and he’s really, really good at this, charmingly assertive, deliciously insistent. That’s his hand on my knee, under my dress and up my smooth leg, up and up until it’s wrapped around my inner thigh. A light brush against the front of my panties, and I whimper in his mouth just as he groans. I think I’m already wet. And he knows I’m already wet, because his fingertips slip under the elastic and hook it to the side. I gasp against his mouth and his thumb slides against my— Someone honks one street over, and we both pull back. Oops. “We should probably . . .” “Yeah. We should.” We’re both in agreement. And both reluctant. We’re slow to let go of each other, and when he turns the key in the ignition, the same hand that uses precision screwdrivers on a daily basis is trembling slightly. I glance out the window. “Levi?” “Yeah?” “I just wanted to say that . . .” I smile. “Red lipstick looks great on you.”

Doesn’t eat it. “I remember.” “We can agree it was a dick move.” “Or.” He drops the bread, leaning back. “Or, we could agree that a few nights before, after a few drinks, I blurted out to Dan that I was . . . interested in a girl named Bee, that Bee’s not a common name, and that Dan was totally the kind of person to look you in the eye and ask, ‘Aren’t you that chick my bro blubbers about when he’s sloshed?’” My heart skips a beat, but I power through. “You can’t have an excuse for every single time you acted like a dick.” He shrugs. “Try me.” “The dress code. A few weeks ago.” He covers his eyes. “You mean, when I asked you to dress professionally while I was wearing a T-shirt with a hole in the right armpit?” “Were you really?” “Most of my T-shirts have armpit holes.

Okay, last one: What about when you refused to collaborate? I overheard you through the door. You told Sam you didn’t want to be on the project because of me.” “You overheard me?” He sounds skeptical. “Through Sam’s solid wood slab of a door?” I bat my eyes angelically. “Yes.” “Were you eavesdropping in the ficus?” “Perhaps. Anything to say in your defense?” “Did you leave right after I mentioned that I didn’t want the project because of you?” “Yup. I stomped my way to my office with the rage of a murder of dragons.” “Is that their collective noun?” “It should be.” He nods. “If you left right after you heard your name, then you didn’t hear everything I told Sam. And that misunderstanding is on you.” I scowl. “Is it?” “Yup. There’s a lesson for all of us here.” He picks up the piece of bread he dropped earlier. “Which would be? Don’t eavesdrop in the ficus?” “Nope. If you eavesdrop, you shouldn’t half-ass it.” He pops the bread into his mouth, and has the audacity to grin at me.

First it’s careful, delicate licks, flicking my clit and nudging my opening; then it’s deep kisses, mapping me thoroughly. “Oh my God,” I moan. His only response is a low, satisfied growl against my folds, and I don’t know if it’s the vibrations, or the enthusiastic way he’s working on me, or the fact that he’s holding me wide open like I am a feast made for him to consume, but my belly tenses, and my limbs are shaking, and keeping my pleading noises in is a losing game. It can’t last, not like this. It takes him less than a minute to push me tumbling over the edge. This is not my body. Or maybe it is, but Levi’s in charge, and I don’t mind. The pleasure takes over, crashes over me like a tidal wave, and before it even dries out I feel him rearranging me once more, pressing my stomach into the mattress again until I’m at his mercy. His fingers are on me, parting me open. Then there is a stretch, a split-second burn, and he’s pushing deep inside. He was there before and it was heaven, but I’m wetter now, and the friction is even more delicious. I feel myself tighten, quick, fluttering contractions around his length. This is. So. Unbelievably. Good. “Jesus,” Levi grunts. Tests a deep, shaky thrust. “You’re still coming, aren’t you?” Yes. No. I don’t know. I twist my neck and turn back. He’s looking down at me. At my flushed skin and my trembling flesh. He’s not going to stop anytime soon, I know it. I’m going to come disastrously quickly, again, or maybe I’ll never stop, and he’s going to stare at me for every last second of it. Caging me, propped up on his huge, shaking arms, with that hungry, spellbound gleam in his eyes. “You’re some kind of fantasy. Built to do this. Built for me. Fuck, Bee.” His rhythm picks up. Uneven and choppy, but it picks up. And I can’t bear it. “You can’t,” I moan. He immediately pauses. “No,” I whine. “Don’t stop.” “You said—?” “Just . . . Please, don’t look at me.” He seems to finally get it. “Hush.” He lowers himself and presses a kiss to my cheekbones. It’s getting—it’s impossible, but it’s getting even better. He’s figured it out, the inside of me. How to angle his thrusts. They’re more shallow, more purposeful, and I’m . . . Babbling. Things like Oh my god and More and Please and Please harder and he somehow knows what I mean. He makes sense of me, and bends down to run his tongue down the skin of my throat, to bite my shoulder, to grunt his pleasure against my nape. “I’m not sure,” he murmurs gutturally, breath harsh against my ear, “how I haven’t come yet.” Me neither, I think. I say his name, muffled in the pillow, and just let go.

“Hey,” I say, averting my eyes. “You okay?” “Nervous. You?” “Fine.” He doesn’t seem fine. I must be communicating it because he adds, “There’s a mess. Not work related—I’ll explain later.” I nod, and for a wild, reckless second, I have the weird impulse of telling him about my mess. I should, shouldn’t I? My name will get out sooner or later. If I tell him now, he’ll . . . Believe that Marie—and therefore me—is a crook. Like everyone else except for Shmac. No, I can’t tell him. He wouldn’t care anyway. “I have something for you,” he says, the corner of his lip curving in a small smile. The back of his hand brushes mine, and my heart squeezes. It likely seems accidental from the outside. It feels anything but. “Yeah?” “I’ll show it to you later. It has to do with your imaginary cat.” I smile weakly. “I can’t wait for Félicette to puke on your keyboard.” He shrugs. “Imaginary vomit’s my favorite kind.” He presses his knee against mine and stands, stopping midway to whisper against the shell of my ear, “I missed you last night.” I shiver. He’s gone before I can answer.

Levi! I don’t even think about it—I run back to where the fight is happening and kick Guy in the ribs so forcefully, I feel a zing of pain travel from my toes up my spinal cord. I blink, and by the time my eyes are open again Levi’s pinning Guy to the floor, holding his arms behind his back. The gun has skittered several feet away. It is, in fact, very close to me. I look at it. Consider picking it up. Decide not to. Levi. “You okay, Bee?” He sounds winded. I nod. “He . . . he . . .” Guy is struggling. Demanding to be let go. Swearing. Insulting Levi, me, the world. My legs feel like Jell-O—the off-brand one, which doesn’t bounce very well. I could use a puke bucket. “Bee?” Levi says. “. . . Yeah?” “Can you do something for me, sweetheart?” Unlikely. “Yeah?” “I want you to take a step to your right. Another. Another.” My knee hits the edge of one of the lobby couches. Levi smiles, like he’s incredibly proud of me. “Perfect. Now sit down.” I do it, confused. There’s something wet on my hand. I look down: Félicette is licking my fingers. “I . . . Why?” “Because I’ll need to restrain Guy until security gets here. And I won’t be able to catch you when you pass out.” “But I . . .” My eyelids flutter closed,

I explained everything to NIH and my superiors, and of course I am begging you on my knees to return—” “You’re standing,” Rocío points out, unimpressed. Levi looks away, biting back a smile. “Rocío,” I scold her gently. “What? Make him grovel harder.”

I struggle to imagine any besides the one. “What else should I do?” I shrug helplessly. “What’s the point of me being here?” In the past two months, I’ve seen a lot of Levi Ward.

He takes a deep breath, and another, but when he looks at me again he’s hardly calmer. “Are you serious?” Icy. His voice, his eyes, the line of his jaw. Pure ice. “I . . . Levi. My presence here was always contingent upon my role in BLINK.” “Was. But things have changed.” “What has changed?” “I don’t know. Maybe the fact that we’ve been together every second of the past two weeks, that we’ve made love every single night, that I know that you sigh in your sleep, that you floss like a maniac, that you taste like honey everywhere.” I feel my cheeks heat. “What does that even mean?” “Are you serious?” he repeats. “All of that—that was just . . . passing time while you were in Houston? Fucking? Is that what it was?” “No. No. But there’s a difference between just passing time and . . .” “And staying. And committing. And actually trying. Is that what you mean?” “I . . .” I what? Am speechless? Confused? Scared? I don’t know what to say, or what he wants. We’re friends. Good friends. Who have sex. Who were always going to go their separate ways—like everyone does. “Levi, this was never meant to . . . I’m just trying to be honest.” “Honest.” He lets out a noiseless, bitter laugh; stares at the hummingbird feeder, his tongue roaming the inside of his cheek. “Honesty. You want some honesty?” “Yes. I just want to be as honest as possible—” “Here’s the honesty: I’m in love with you. But that’s not news. Not to me, and not to you, I don’t think. Not if you’re honest with yourself—which you say you are, right?” My eyes widen. He powers on, ruthless, merciless. Levi Ward: force of nature. Sucking the air out of my lungs. “Here’s something else that’s honest: you’re in love with me, too.” “Levi.” I shake my head, panic licking up my spine. “I—” “But you’re scared. You’re scared shitless, and I don’t blame you. Tim was a piece of shit and I want to cut off his balls.

Every single person you’ve cared about has disappeared from your life, one way or another.” I don’t know how he manages to look so angry, so calm, so compassionate at the same time. “I understand. I can be patient. I’ve tried, will try to be patient. But I need . . . something. I need you to understand that this is not a book you’re writing. We’re not—not two characters you can keep apart because it makes for a literary ending. These are our lives, Bee.”

That’s what I want, you know? I want nice.” I’ve had so little of it. I was always, always being left behind. And the only way to not be left behind is to leave first. I wipe my cheek with the back of my hand, sniffling. “If nice means being alone, then . . . so be it.” “I can give you nice. I can give you better than nice. I can give you everything.” He smiles at me, full of hope. “You don’t even have to admit to yourself that you love me, Bee. God knows I love you enough for the both of us. But I need you to stay. I need you to stick around. Not in Houston, if you don’t want to. I’ll follow you, if you ask me to. But—” “And when you get tired of me?” I’m a wet, trembling mess. “When you can’t be around anymore? When you meet someone else?” “I won’t,” he says, and I hate how sure, how resigned he sounds. “You don’t know that. You can’t know that. You—” “There hasn’t been anyone else.” His jaw tenses and works. “Since the first moment I saw you. Since the first moment I talked to you and made an ass of myself, there hasn’t been anyone else.” Does he— He doesn’t mean it. He can’t mean that. “Yes,” he says ardently, reading my mind. “In all the ways you’re imagining. If you’re going to decide, you should have the facts. I know you’re scared— do you think I’m not scared?” “Not the way I am—” “I spent years—years—hoping to find another who could measure up. Hoping to feel something—anything—for someone else. And now you’re here, and—I have had you, Bee. I know how it can be. You think I don’t know what it feels like, to want something so much you’re afraid to let yourself take it? Even when it’s in front of you? Do you think I’m not fucking scared?” He exhales, running a hand through his hair. “Bee. You want to belong. You want someone who won’t let go. I’m it. I didn’t let go of you for years, and I didn’t even have you. But you need to let me.”

I’m busy.” I sip my coffee as I watch him navigate this. It’s fun watching him squirm. “Doing what?” Saba frowns. “I have a project to finish with Claire. We started it last night, and it still needs work.” The girls’ faces fall in disappointment. “No, that’s fine, Tristan,” I interrupt. “I finished the job myself after you left.” He blinks in disbelief and then narrows his eyes. “Is that so?” “Uh-huh.” I sip my coffee, acting innocent. He glares at me. “Yeah, that’s probably why I slept so well. Felt so good to finally get the project done, you know?” “I would have done it better,” he replies flatly. “Oh, well, you didn’t.” I smile sweetly. “I saved you the job. You should go party with the girls. I’m sure they’re going to be great fun.” “Yes.” The girls all giggle on cue, and he looks at me deadpan. The bell rings for us to return, and everyone stands and leaves us alone. “Finished the job, did you?” he whispers. I shrug casually. “It had to be done.” He stands and does his suit jacket up with one hand, unimpressed. “You’re a smart-ass, Anderson.” “Have fun with the girls tonight,” I whisper. “Although, I really don’t know how you would handle three?” “You’re going to fucking get it.” He marches off toward the conference room, clearly annoyed, and I smile after him.

His dark eyes meet mine. “Or we can go back to New York until I eventually wear you down—for then I will fuck you on your desk. It will be hard and wet and messy, and who knows who might walk in on us.”

I could pretend that I like you and that I want to explore our friendship or some fucking bullshit.” He sips his drink. “Or I could just tell you the truth.” “Which is?” I breathe. Our eyes are locked. “The idea of you hating me while I lick you up is a fucking turn-on,” he whispers.

“You have an ugly sex face,” I say. He bursts out laughing. “I told you, no talking.” We both laugh, and then he falls serious and watches me for a moment as he pumps me deep. This just feels so raw and real. “You need to come. You need to come,” he stammers. “I can’t stop it. You need to come,” he begins to chant. “Anderson.” He screws his face up, as if in pain. “No,” I snap. “I’m not ready.” I ride his beautiful deep pumps . . . so good. “Oh . . . fuck it.” I feel the telling jerk of his cock, and he moans, deep and loud, and then goes into a frenzy of deep pumps to completely empty himself. God, I want to do this all night. “Tristan,” I whisper. “What the fuck . . . too quick?” I tease. If I’m honest, I love that he couldn’t hold it. I love that he was so turned on that he had no control. This isn’t about orgasms for me. It’s about a connection that I’ve been missing, but I’ll never let him in on my little secret.

Oh, he’s fun, all right. “Forget it, Mr. Miles. You only got one go.”

“About time.” I smirk. He takes me into his arms. “Anderson.” He smiles down at me as he pumps my hips into his. “Fancy seeing you here.” I smile goofily up at him. He towers above me. He must be six foot three at least. His dark hair is messed to perfection, and his lips are a perfect shade of come fuck me . “Well, I felt sorry for you.” I shrug. “This is a pity date.” I look around at the grand apartment. “Not sure if I can spend the whole weekend in this dump, though.” He chuckles. “I do love your smart-ass mouth.” He pumps me with his hips once more. “I may have to fuck it later.”

I stare at his beautiful face for a moment. “Tristan Miles, I have never met anyone quite like you.” “Ditto.” He holds his glass up. “A toast.” I take a big gulp of my champagne and touch my glass with his. “To swallowing semen,” he says. What the hell? I snort and spit my drink out, and it spurts all over the table as I laugh out loud. “You’re head obsessed today.” He sits back in his chair; his eyes are alight with mischief. “That’s because I can’t stop thinking about it.” “Tristan.” I lean forward in my chair. He leans forward, too, mimicking me. “Yes, Claire.” “Be a good boy, and you might get what you want.” He smiles darkly. “Or be a bad boy, and take it anyway.” The air crackles between us; our eyes are locked, and nerves flutter deep in my stomach. I think those two lines just summed up the entirety of Tristan Miles. I can kid myself all I want about being in charge. We both know I’m not.

He flicks the blankets back, exposing his naked body. “I suppose you can help yourself,” he huffs, as if I am an inconvenience. “I am sleeping through it, though. Don’t expect any input from me.” I laugh and kiss his chest as I work my way down his body toward his dick. “Yes, dear, whatever you say.”

“I’m not joking,” I bark. “Give me your clothes and shoes. Right now.” Sammia and Mallory are laughing hard at the door. “Not fucking funny, you two,” I cry. “Sammia, call Claire and tell her the cat is going to hell. When I get ahold of that thing . . . tick fucking tock.” I punch my fist hard. The three of them burst out laughing again. Jameson stands and begins to unbutton his shirt. “I thought Elliot and Christopher were coming in today. Take their suits.” “They won’t be here until after ten. They have a breakfast meeting.” “Sammia, can you find Jameson some clothes, please?” I stammer. “Do I have to?” She sighs dreamily. He hands over his shirt, and we suddenly become aware of the three reception girls standing at the door watching, and we both glance over. Sammia gives us a goofy smile and shrugs. “Don’t mind us; this is the most exciting thing that’s happened in the office for like . . . forever.” I glance at Jameson, and he rolls his eyes. What must we look like, both shirtless and half-undressed in the office? “Fucking perverts,” I huff. “Go watch some porn or something.” “This is better.” Sammia sighs again. “Jesus Christ,” Jameson mutters under his breath.

a route the Mind of a small, archaic warship could plan for, create and follow. By the time it was noticed that the ship’s Mind had taken exactly that path through its screen of annihilation, it was too late to stop it from falling away through hyperspace towards the small, cold planet fourth out from the single yellow sun of the nearby system. It was also too late to do anything about the light from the ship’s exploding warheads, which had been arranged in a crude code, describing the vessel’s fate and the escaped Mind’s status and position, and legible to anybody catching the unreal light as it sped through the galaxy. Perhaps worst of all - and had their design permitted such a thing, those electronic brains would now have

I don’t care how self-righteous the Culture feels, or how many people the Idirans kill. They’re on the side of life - boring, old-fashioned, biological life; smelly, fallible and short-sighted, God knows, butreal life. You’re ruled by your machines. You’re an evolutionary dead end. The trouble is that to take your mind off it you try to drag everybody else down there with you. The worst thing that

Horza thought he knew what the woman meant. Special Circumstances had always been the Contact section’s moral espionage weapon, the very cutting edge of the Culture’s interfering diplomatic policy, the elite of the elite, in a society which abhorred elitism. Even before the war, its standing and its image within the Culture had been ambiguous. It was glamorous but dangerous, possessed of an aura of roguish sexiness - there was no other word for it - which implied predation, seduction, even violation. It had about it too an atmosphere of secrecy (in a society that virtually worshipped openness) which hinted at unpleasant, shaming deeds, and an ambience of moral relativity (in a society which clung to its absolutes: life/good, death/bad; pleasure/good, pain/bad)

Changer was a threat to anybody who ruled by force, either of will or of arms. Amahain-Frolk had known that, and so would Kraiklyn. There was also a degree of human-basic revulsion reserved for Horza’s species. Not only were they much altered from their original genetic stock, they were a threat to identity, a challenge to the individualism even of those they were never likely to impersonate. It had nothing to do with souls or physical or spiritual possession; it was, as the Idirans well understood, the behaviouristic copying of another which revolted. Individuality, the thing which most humans held more precious than anything else about themselves, was somehow cheapened by the ease with which a Changer could ignore it as a limitation and use it as a disguise.
